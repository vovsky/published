  <h1>2025 04 27   5 Reasons Your Joe Dispenza Meditations Aren't Working</h1>

<p>Your Joe Dispenza meditations aren't working, and it's not because the technique is flawed, but it's because of how you may be approaching it. And after working with hundreds of clients, I've discovered 5 critical mistakes that are blocking your results. Now, most people are stuck in what I call meditation limbo, they're doing the practice but missing the transformation.</p>
<p>And so today I'm going to show you exactly how to fix these blocks and finally experience the breakthrough that you've been waiting for. Now, here's the thing, I tried Joe Dispenza's meditations for months, years actually with zero results. I was doing everything right, following every step, and still nothing.</p>
<p>Then I discovered 5 mistakes that were blocking my manifestations, and within weeks, weeks, everything shifted. So please write this down, take notes, because these are actually going to change your practice completely. Now, the first reason that your meditations aren't working is something nobody talks about, inconsistent practice that is literally creating conflicting neural pathways in your brain.</p>
<p>Think about this, you meditate in the morning, you feel amazing, creating those neural connections, and then what happens? Well, sometimes you may go right back to your old frequency for the rest of the day. I've seen with clients that they go back to their old self, their old frequency, right after meditation. And so, it's like trying to build a house where you add one more brick in the morning and then you spend the rest of the day tearing down three bricks.</p>
<p>You take one step, take three steps back. Now, your brain doesn't know which pattern to strengthen. Which neural pathway is it going to strengthen? Because remember, by the age 39, by age 35, 95% of who we are becomes a set of memorized behaviors, emotional reactions, and habits.</p>
<p>When you meditate inconsistently, or when you have an inconsistent state of being, you're actually strengthening the neural conflict, not resolving it. And I remember when I first started Joe's work, I'd do an amazing meditation in the morning, feel incredible, and then I would check my phone immediately, see an email from a client who hadn't paid, and then boom, right back into stress, cortisol, adrenaline, the exact opposite of what I just meditated for. Now, here's what changed everything.</p>
<p>Instead of just meditating once a day, I started doing what I call reinforcements. And so, every two hours, I would take 60 seconds just to reconnect with that elevated emotion from my morning meditation. Just 60 seconds, okay? But this constant reinforcement is what finally allowed my brain to strengthen those new neural pathways that I was creating, instead of constantly trying to have a conflict with them, okay? And look, I get it, you're busy, we all are, but are you too busy for 60 seconds every couple of hours? Because that 60 seconds might be the difference between manifestation or frustration, or creating a repeated pattern, okay? The second reason your meditations aren't working is that you are rushing through brainwave states.</p>
<p>This was my mistake for months, I was rushing through brainwave states. Here's what's happening when we do Dr. Joe's meditations. Joe's meditations are designed to take you from beta brainwaves, your normal analytical thinking state, through to alpha, into theta, delta, and then gamma.</p>
<p>Now, that alpha and theta state is where the magic happens. It is where you can actually reprogram your subconscious mind. But here's the problem.</p>
<p>Most of us are conditioned to rush through everything in life, right? It's been conditioned in us. Everyone's just rushing, everyone's just go, go, go. You look around in public, everyone's just trying to rush through their next destination.</p>
<p>And we rush in meditation too. We're like, okay, breathing, check, body scan, check, now let's get to the good stuff. We never drop into that theta state where transformation happens.</p>
<p>Your analytical mind, that voice that's always yapping away, it lives in high beta brainwaves. And that analytical mind is going to fight you. It's going to send you thoughts like, this isn't working, I don't have time for this.</p>
<p>Then I remember to check that email or reply to that email. And this is the moment people quit. But these thoughts aren't yours.</p>
<p>Remember, they are just your old programming trying to maintain control. Oh man, and I remember trying to, sitting in a meditation and my mind would race with thoughts like, you've got a full on day today. And then I would think about what type of content to create.</p>
<p>Or, this isn't working, you know what I mean? I would get frustrated and give up, literally, I would stand up from my meditation. But then I learned something, and this changed everything. Instead of finding these thoughts, I started to simply observe them.</p>
<p>Oh, there's my old self again. Or sometimes when it is really fighting me, I would be stern with these thoughts. I would declare it, hey, I'm meditating right now, try it, it works.</p>
<p>And I would gently return back to my breath, and then allowing myself to sink deeper and deeper back into the present moment, and relaxing even more. Simple as that. The key is patience.</p>
<p>It takes time for your brain to slow down into these waves. On average, maybe it takes about 10 to 15 minutes of consistent meditation before you stop dropping into those deeper states. If you are rushing or checking the time, you're never going to get there.</p>
<p>So, here's what I started doing. I picked a beautiful song without Jo's voice, and just focused on getting my nervous system to relax, just by breathing and relaxing for the whole song, 5-10 minutes. This gives me permission to take my time to get into that state, without the pressure of doing it right or doing it fast.</p>
<p>Third reason your meditations aren't working is, this is most critical. You are not generating enough emotional intensity during your mental rehearsals. This was a big breakthrough.</p>
<p>For months, I was mentally rehearsing my desired reality, seeing it clearly in my mind's eye, but I wasn't feeling it with any emotional intensity. Now here's the thing, Jo says your thoughts are electrical, but your emotions are magnetic. They are what actually draws your creation to you.</p>
<p>And Jo talks about this all the time, it's not enough to think about your new reality, you have to feel it so completely that your body believes it's already happening. But here's what most people get wrong, they try to create positive emotions from a place of lack, like trying to be wealthy while staring at your empty bank account, right? It doesn't work, because your body knows you're faking it. Now listen very carefully, the secret is what I call emotional borrowing.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to force emotions about something you don't have yet, borrow an emotional intensity from an experience you have already had. For example, maybe remember a time where you felt absolute joy, gratitude, a love, an accomplishment, right? When you accomplish something, and really step into that memory. You see what you see, experience what you were experiencing, hear what you heard, feel what you felt, and get that emotion flowing into your body first, and then while maintaining that elevated emotional state, introduce your mental rehearsal.</p>
<p>That's it. That simple trigger is going to help you out. Now this is the difference between intellectual mental rehearsal and embodied mental rehearsal.</p>
<p>One is just thinking, the other is being. And I remember when I finally got this, instead of trying to feel wealthy, which was hard because I was in debt, like 6 figures worth of debt, I recalled the feeling of holding my nephew for the first time, and that overwhelming love and gratitude. I got that emotion flowing through my body.</p>
<p>And then while maintaining that state, I introduced my mental rehearsal of financial abundance. I was doing changing boxes a lot, and so it was just a feeling of love, gratitude, feeling of relief. The difference was night and day, because my body was already in that elevated emotional state, and so it could accept the new programming without resistance.</p>
<p>It could accept that mental rehearsal without resistance. Here's your homework. Before your next meditation, make a list of at least 3-5 peak emotional experiences from your past, and I know you've had some.</p>
<p>Times where you felt absolutely joy, joyous, love, gratitude, accomplishment, powerful. Use these as emotional launching pads. Now, the fourth reason your meditations aren't working is that you understand Joe's work intellectually, but you haven't embodied the work.</p>
<p>This is a big one, and this was me for so long. I could explain quantum physics, I could explain epigenetics, all the work, heart coherence. I knew all the concepts.</p>
<p>I was that annoying guy at the parties talking about how thoughts create reality. But I wasn't living it. I wasn't even talking to the girls that I would go on dates with about reality creation.</p>
<p>But there's a massive difference between knowing something and intellectually knowing it in yourselves. Your body doesn't respond to what you notice, it responds to what you embody. Now, think about it like this.</p>
<p>You can read every book about swimming. You can watch every YouTube video about swimming. You can know the proper techniques.</p>
<p>But until you actually get in the water, you don't really know how to swim. And same with this work. You can understand all the concepts, you can quote Joe's work word for word.</p>
<p>But until you embody them, until it becomes your default operating system, sorry my friend, it's going to be hard to change. But how do you go from intellectual understanding to embodiment? Through feeling it with yourselves. Well, it's through consistent practice and what I call testing reality.</p>
<p>Testing reality. It is where you take small risks to test your new beliefs in the real world. For example, if you're meditating on abundance, maybe you buy someone coffee unexpectedly, right? It is a small act of kindness that reinforces your new belief that you have more than enough.</p>
<p>These small acts build evidence for your new beliefs, which helps your body accept them faster. It's like building a bridge between your meditation practice and your daily life. When I started doing this, oh my gosh, after meditating on abundance, I would give small gifts to my loved ones.</p>
<p>Whether if it was just food, bottle of wine, whatever. Each time I did it, I was teaching my body that my new beliefs were real. I was reinforcing them.</p>
<p>So start small, find ways to test your new beliefs in the real world. These reality tests are what transforms intellectual concepts into embodied knowing. Plus also doing the meditations gets you to embody it.</p>
<p>So the more you do the meditations, you're actually signaling new cells and new genes of that person or of that state of being. Last one that your meditations aren't working is that you are not preparing your nervous system before meditation. Listen very carefully to this because this was a game changer for me.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would jump straight into meditation. Sometimes I would jump from checking my emails or from Instagram straight into meditation. Then I wonder why I couldn't calm my mind or access any elevated emotions.</p>
<p>Here's what's happening. When you're in your normal day-to-day life, your nervous system is likely in sympathetic mode, fight or flight. Your heart's beating faster.</p>
<p>Your muscles are tense. You're breathing shallows. And this is not a state conductive to meditation or even manifestation.</p>
<p>You're not in a place to create, my friend. Before you can effectively meditate, you need to shift your nervous system into parasympathetic mode, rest and digestion or in a state of creation. That's what I call it.</p>
<p>This is where healing happens, where creativity flows, where manifestation becomes possible. But how do you make this shift? Well, through intentional nervous system regulation before you meditate. Here's what I do.</p>
<p>This is my pre-meditation ritual that changed everything. So write this down. This is yours.</p>
<p>I first put a calming song on with no lyrics that lasts about 5 to 10 minutes. I told you this before. Just pick a song.</p>
<p>Type in a meditation song on Spotify or something. Next, heart-focused breathing. Place your hand in your heart and take slow, deep breaths.</p>
<p>And imagine breathing and flowing through in and out of your heart. This activates your heart coherence, which Joe talks about extensively. And then after that is just progressive relaxation.</p>
<p>I'm noticing any tenseness or tension in any areas of my body. Once you have identified any tenseness, denseness or tension, I want you to literally speak to that part of your body. You can even tell it to just relax.</p>
<p>It's safe. It's okay to relax. It's okay to be... It's safe, right? And it signals your body that it's safe to relax.</p>
<p>And just breathe into those parts of your bodies. This pre-meditation ritual takes about 5 to 10 minutes. But it makes a huge difference between a meditation that transforms and one that frustrates.</p>
<p>And I remember when I started implementing this ritual, my meditations immediately became deeper. My mental rehearsals became more vivid. And my emotional responses became more authentic.</p>
<p>All because I took the time to prepare my nervous system. Now, here's the step most meditators forget. And it might be the most important part of it all, which is maintaining your state after meditation.</p>
<p>This is where the real magic happens. Your meditation creates the blueprint. But how you live the rest of your day determines on whether that blueprint becomes your reality.</p>
<p>Most people meditate, feel amazing, and then immediately check their phone, remember their problems, or jump into problem-solving mode as well. Oh, how am I going to do this? How is this going to happen? And just like that, instantly, they're back into their old frequency, their old self, old reality. Now, remember what I'm about to say.</p>
<p>The strongest frequency wins. The strongest frequency wins. If you spend 30 minutes in your new frequency and 23 and a half hours in your old one, guess which frequency wins? That's right.</p>
<p>But how do you maintain this state throughout the day? Now, this is what I call frequency anchors. Small practices that keep you connected to your elevated state. What I do is I set reminders on my phone, and I take three conscious breaths every hour.</p>
<p>I also create the environmental triggers. So maybe every time you wash your hands, take a moment to just reconnect with gratitude. I'm always driving as well.</p>
<p>So whenever I step into my car, I embody myself. My new self is driving that car. Use pattern interrupts when you notice yourself slipping into old emotional states, okay? A simple phrase like when you're overthinking or starting to come up with how or when it's going to happen.</p>
<p>Nope, that's not me. That's my old self. Okay, then redirect.</p>
<p>Or simply do Joe's walking meditations. These frequency anchors might seem small, but they are what allow you to maintain your elevated state throughout the day, which is where the real transformation happens. When I first started implementing these anchors, I set an alarm on my phone every two hours as a reminder to connect with my elevated emotional state.</p>
<p>At first, it felt forced, but then soon it became automatic. And that's when my manifestation started to accelerate, okay? They started to accelerate when my new frequency became my default state, not just in my meditation, okay? So let's bring this all together into a complete practice that actually works. So first, please prepare your nervous system before meditation with heart-focused breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, alongside with a calm song with no lyrics.</p>
<p>And then take your time. Take your time to enter deeper brainwave states. Don't rush the process, okay? There is no destination in meditation.</p>
<p>And then next is generate authentic emotional intensity by borrowing from previous experiences in your past. And then test your new beliefs in the real world to move from intellectual understanding to embodiment. And then maintain your elevated state throughout the day with frequency anchors.</p>
<p>How simple is that? It's simple, but it is not easy. But practice consistently. Daily meditation plus reinforcement moments every few hours.</p>
<p>This complete practice addresses all five reasons why your Zhou meditations haven't been working. And when you implement these things consistently, I promise you, everything will change. Everything Zhou is speaking about is absolutely true.</p>
<p>Everything will change. I went from frustrated and in debt to manifesting opportunities that I couldn't have ever imagined, ever have imagined. But more importantly, I went from constantly seeking outside of myself to finding that unshakable inner peace that Zhou talks about.</p>
<p>That state where you no longer are emotionally dependent on the conditions in your life. And that, that's the real gift of this work. Yeah, the manifestations are amazing, but the true transformation is who you become in the process.</p>
<p>Someone who is no longer at the mercy of external circumstances. You're not a bitch to life. Someone who has remembered their connection to the divine, to the field of all possibilities.</p>
<p>Someone who has come home to themselves. Now I want to know which of these five mistakes resonated with you the most and what changes are you going to implement in your practice? Let me know in the comment section below. I would love to know.</p>

<p>But remember, you're ready for this breakthrough. You're so ready for this. You are ready to stop waiting and start creating.</p>
<p>You are ready to become the person who already has what you are trying to manifest.</p>
