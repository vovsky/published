<ul>
<li>Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Langer">Ellen Langer</a> is a professor of psychology at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University">Harvard University</a> and a leading pioneer in the mind-body connection, specifically how thoughts impact health <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=14s">(00:00:14)</a>.</li>
<li>Dr. Langer's laboratory has made numerous fascinating findings, including a study where older adults lived in a laboratory designed to resemble their environment 20 years prior, resulting in increased mobility, better cognitive function, and reversed biological aging markers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=39s">(00:00:39)</a>.</li>
<li>The study demonstrates the power of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind">Mind</a> over biology, with changes in environment and interaction leading to significant improvements in less than one week <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=63s">(00:01:03)</a>.</li>
<li>Dr. Langer's work focuses on the acquisition of knowledge and mindset in dictating health and well-being, including longevity, exercise, weight loss, infectious disease, and cancer outcomes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=91s">(00:01:31)</a>.</li>
<li>The discussion covers examples, mechanisms, and practical applications of these concepts, aiming to change the way people think about the mind-body connection and health <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=123s">(00:02:03)</a>.</li>
<li>Dr. Langer's approach emphasizes that the mind-body connection is not just about positive thinking, but rather a unique way of thinking about scientific questions, health, and life in general <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=131s">(00:02:11)</a>.</li>
<li>Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Langer">Ellen Langer</a> is a luminary and pioneer in the area of mind-body health, known for her scientific rigor and ability to teach complex concepts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=149s">(00:02:29)</a>.</li>

<h2 id="mindfulness-000257">Mindfulness <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=177s">(00:02:57)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#mindfulness-000257" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Mindfulness is a way of being, not a practice, and it involves the simple process of noticing, which can be achieved through actively noticing new things or recognizing that everything is always changing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=216s">(00:03:36)</a>.</li>
<li>There are two ways to achieve mindfulness: bottom-up, by actively noticing three new things about a person, place, or thing, and top-down, by recognizing that everything is always changing and uncertainty is the rule <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=224s">(00:03:44)</a>.</li>
<li>One of the things people think they know best is how much is one plus one, but this is not always the case, as the answer can vary depending on the context and the number system being used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=263s">(00:04:23)</a>.</li>
<li>In the real world, one plus one probably doesn't equal two as often as people think, and this is because the world is not constant and absolute answers are not always applicable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=307s">(00:05:07)</a>.</li>
<li>When people know they don't know something, they pay attention, and when they pay attention, they have choices that they would otherwise be blind to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=349s">(00:05:49)</a>.</li>
<li>Mindfulness is not the same as meditation, although meditation can be a practice that leads to post-meditative mindfulness <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=196s">(00:03:16)</a>.</li>
<li>Most people are mindless almost all the time and are oblivious to it, and this is partly due to the way they were taught in school, which emphasizes absolute answers and certainty <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=375s">(00:06:15)</a>.</li>
<li>Schools are seen as the biggest culprits in teaching people to be mindless, as they often present the world as constant and unchanging, leading people not to notice the uncertainty and variability of the world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=388s">(00:06:28)</a>.</li>

<h2 id="mindless-focus-being-mindful-000653">Mindless, Focus; Being Mindful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=413s">(00:06:53)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#mindless-focus-being-mindful-000653" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Mindfulness has become a widely accepted practice in the last 20 years, but prior to that, it was considered alternative and hippy, with meditation being a valuable practice that has become more common <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=416s">(00:06:56)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of mindlessness was initially studied, which led to experiences such as walking into a mannequin and apologizing, showing the effects of being mindless <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=441s">(00:07:21)</a>.</li>
<li>A person once said, "You are what you study," which led to a shift in focus from mindlessness to mindfulness, and the discovery of meditation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and a new way of being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=453s">(00:07:33)</a>.</li>
<li>Western society has now embraced the idea of presence, but it often gets merged with rigid terms like focus and attention, with focus being actually mindless <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=490s">(00:08:10)</a>.</li>
<li>Focusing on something, like a finger, can cause the image to move around, whereas looking at it mindfully allows for noticing new things and keeping the image still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=507s">(00:08:27)</a>.</li>
<li>Instructions to focus can be misleading, as it implies holding something still, whereas mindfulness is about actively noticing and allowing things to vary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=539s">(00:08:59)</a>.</li>
<li>Mindfulness is not a practice, but rather an exploration of presence and uncertainty, and it's not necessary to practice it when you're in a new situation, as you'll naturally notice things <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=575s">(00:09:35)</a>.</li>
<li>Mindfulness is what you're doing when you're having fun, and it's an act of noticing that is energy-begetting, not consuming, making it feel good and beneficial for your health <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=623s">(00:10:23)</a>.</li>
<li>Being mindful makes people find you more appealing and charismatic, enhances the products you produce, and is healthier <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=651s">(00:10:51)</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Meditation is considered a gateway into mindfulness, and it is one way to achieve this state, although it is not the only way and is not mutually exclusive with other practices <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=823s">(00:13:43)</a>.</li>
<li>Research was conducted on meditation in the 80s, and it was found to be wonderful, but it is different from mindfulness <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=835s">(00:13:55)</a>.</li>
<li>The advantages of meditating may not be directly related to the meditation practice itself, but rather to the time investment and commitment required to meditate, such as sitting for 20 minutes twice a day <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=859s">(00:14:19)</a>.</li>
<li>The time investment in meditation may lead to positive changes, such as becoming a kinder and nicer person, not necessarily due to the meditation practice, but because of the effort and dedication put into it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=863s">(00:14:23)</a>.</li>
<li>This idea is considered heretical in the world of wellness, but it is possible that both the inherent properties of meditation and the time investment contribute to its benefits <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=870s">(00:14:30)</a>.</li>
<li>Meditation and mindfulness are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible to practice both and experience their individual benefits <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=877s">(00:14:37)</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Research was conducted in the 1970s with people in nursing homes to see if giving them choices would get them more engaged in their living, as it was distressing to see people barely existing in these homes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=946s">(00:15:46)</a>.</li>
<li>The study involved giving one group of people choices, such as deciding where to visit others, whether to see a movie on Tuesday or Thursday, and taking care of a plant, while the comparison group, the Tender Loving Care Group, had everything controlled for them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=987s">(00:16:27)</a>.</li>
<li>The results of the study showed that the people who were given choices lived longer, with the study finding a significant difference 18 months later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1042s">(00:17:22)</a>.</li>
<li>The study's findings led to further research on the relationship between choice-making and health, with the realization that making choices can have a positive impact on one's physical health and longevity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1051s">(00:17:31)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of epiphenomena was discussed, with the idea that exercise and its effects on health may be an epiphenomenon, and that looking at things through a different perspective can be valuable regardless of the experimental outcome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=907s">(00:15:07)</a>.</li>
<li>The idea of mindlessness and mindfulness was also explored, with the realization that people often do not make choices that are good for them, and that being mindful can have a positive impact on one's health <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1083s">(00:18:03)</a>.</li>
<li>The notion of the mind-body connection was discussed, with the idea that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind">Mind</a> and body are not separate entities, but are interconnected, and that by putting the mind and body back together, people can have enormous control over their health and well-being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1110s">(00:18:30)</a>.</li>
<li>A personal experience of eating a pancreas on a honeymoon in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Paris</a> led to an exploration of the mind-body connection, as the individual made themselves sick after eating the pancreas, thinking it was something else <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1140s">(00:19:00)</a>.</li>
<li>Another personal experience involved a mother who had breast cancer that metastasized to her pancreas, but she managed to make herself well, further highlighting the mind-body connection <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1200s">(00:20:00)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of the mind-body connection is not a connection between two separate things, but rather a single entity where the mind and body are one, eliminating the need for a mediator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1228s">(00:20:28)</a>.</li>
<li>A study was conducted where elderly men lived in a retreat that had been retrofitted to 20 years earlier, and they were asked to live as if they were their younger selves, resulting in improved vision, hearing, memory, strength, and a noticeably younger appearance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1260s">(00:21:00)</a>.</li>
<li>A study with Ally explored the importance of understanding exercise to its effects, and it was found that hotel maids who were taught to view their work as exercise had better health outcomes than those who did not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1295s">(00:21:35)</a>.</li>
<li>The study with hotel maids involved dividing them into two groups, one of which was taught to view their work as exercise, and it was found that this group had better health outcomes despite not actually exercising more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1364s">(00:22:44)</a>.</li>
<li>The study's findings suggest that the understanding of exercise is crucial to its effects, and that simply viewing one's work as exercise can have positive health outcomes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1379s">(00:22:59)</a>.</li>
<li>A study was conducted where two groups of people were measured, and it was found that the group who changed their mindset and saw their work as exercise lost weight, had a change in waist to hip ratio and body mass index, and their blood pressure came down, despite not eating any differently or working harder than the other group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1382s">(00:23:02)</a>.</li>
<li>The study was a test of the nocebo effect, which is the reverse of the placebo effect, where something that is nothing has an effect as if it's something, and in this case, people were doing exercise but didn't realize it and it got rid of the effect <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1411s">(00:23:31)</a>.</li>
<li>An early study on the nocebo effect involved giving people ipecac, which is supposed to make them vomit, but telling them it would stop their vomiting, and it actually stopped their vomiting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1437s">(00:23:57)</a>.</li>
<li>Placebo studies have shown that people's bodies react to their thoughts, such as when people are rubbed with a leaf they think is poisonous ivy, they get a rash, but if they don't think it's poisonous ivy, they don't get a rash <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1463s">(00:24:23)</a>.</li>
<li>Placebos are considered to be a strong medicine, but they have gotten a bad rap, primarily because pharmaceutical companies need to show that their drugs outperform placebos in order to bring them to market <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1488s">(00:24:48)</a>.</li>
<li>When people think they were given a placebo, they often get upset, but they should be excited because if the placebo didn't cure them, it means they cured themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1496s">(00:24:56)</a>.</li>
<li>The pharmaceutical industry's influence is thought to be a reason why placebos have gotten a bad reputation, as companies want to emphasize the effectiveness of their drugs over placebos in order to make a profit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1513s">(00:25:13)</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>The division of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind">Mind</a> and body is considered one of the greatest mistakes in thinking in psychology and Western medicine, as the brain and body are connected bidirectionally through the nervous system and other systems like the hormone and immune systems <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1550s">(00:25:50)</a>.</li>
<li>The history of medicine and the merge of philosophy and medicine have contributed to the confusion about how medicine is done and should be done, with rules, restrictions, and cultural conventions playing a significant role <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1606s">(00:26:46)</a>.</li>
<li>The book "The Prince of Medicine" details the reasons for this confusion and the mess created by these conventions, which includes the idea that the brain is the seat of consciousness and the mind-body distinction <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1617s">(00:26:57)</a>.</li>
<li>The mind-body distinction has poisoned thinking about what's possible, and experiments have shown that the mind and body are not separate entities, but rather a single thing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1666s">(00:27:46)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of self is not necessarily tied to the mind-body distinction, and one's identity remains the same regardless of whether they have a mind, body, or other physical attributes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1698s">(00:28:18)</a>.</li>
<li>The flexibility of thinking around the mind-body concept is important, and considering the effects of exercise as epiphenomena can help in understanding the relationship between the mind and body <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1721s">(00:28:41)</a>.</li>
<li>Losing a piece of the body, such as fingers, does not fundamentally change a person, but losing a piece of neural real estate can change one's personality, which is the only thing that anchors the idea that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind">Mind</a> and body are separate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1742s">(00:29:02)</a>.</li>
<li>The example of an athlete losing two fingers illustrates that the loss of a physical attribute does not change a person's fundamental identity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1747s">(00:29:07)</a>.</li>
<li>The mind and body are interconnected, and changes in one can affect the other, with bidirectionality between the two, meaning that changes in breathing or thinking can impact one's state of mind and physical health <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1761s">(00:29:21)</a>.</li>
<li>The brain and body are closely linked, and whatever is happening in the brain is also happening in the body, and vice versa, with everything being simultaneously connected, not sequentially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1863s">(00:31:03)</a>.</li>
<li>A person's physical health and emotions can be reflected in various parts of their body, such as their skin, eyes, and even tears, with a teardrop of sadness being biochemically different from a teardrop of joy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1873s">(00:31:13)</a>.</li>
<li>The idea that the mind can influence physical health is demonstrated by the story of visiting an iridologist, who claimed to have seen a problem with the gallbladder by looking at the iris, which was later found to be true <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1820s">(00:30:20)</a>.</li>
<li>The possibility that the suggestion of a gallbladder problem by the iridologist led to the actual problem is also considered, highlighting the potential power of suggestion and the interconnectedness of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind">Mind</a> and body <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1905s">(00:31:45)</a>.</li>
<li>The interconnectedness of the mind and body is not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms and relationships between the two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1778s">(00:29:38)</a>.</li>
<li>The use of modern technology, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging">Functional magnetic resonance imaging</a>, has led to a greater understanding of the brain and its functions, but it also has limitations and may lead people to overlook the interconnectedness of the mind and body <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1780s">(00:29:40)</a>.</li>
<li>The idea that everything is simultaneously connected and happening on every level is a key concept in understanding the mind-body connection, and it is essential to consider this when exploring the relationship between the two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1866s">(00:31:06)</a>.</li>

<li>Thoughts on alternative practices like acupuncture involve considering the entire experience, including the diagnostic process of examining tongue texture and color, which may be influenced by the placebo effect, indicating that our thoughts control a significant portion of our physical health and longevity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1936s">(00:32:16)</a>.</li>
<li>The placebo effect is present in most medical treatments, suggesting that our thoughts play a crucial role in our physical well-being, and embracing this concept can lead to positive changes in our health <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1962s">(00:32:42)</a>.</li>
<li>A personal experience with a family member's illness led to the realization that maintaining a positive mindset and surrounding oneself with uplifting people can potentially improve health outcomes, although it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of this approach in individual cases <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=1991s">(00:33:11)</a>.</li>
<li>Providing a loved one with a gift, such as expensive golf clubs, can be a way of demonstrating a positive and hopeful attitude towards their recovery, even if the outcome is uncertain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2029s">(00:33:49)</a>.</li>
<li>The importance of perceived control in health outcomes was a concept that was not fully applied in this personal experience, as the decision-making process was taken over, highlighting the need for a balance between control and autonomy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2073s">(00:34:33)</a>.</li>
<li>The recovery from illness in this personal experience was a significant event that reinforced the idea that our thoughts and attitudes can influence our physical health <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2096s">(00:34:56)</a>.</li>
<li>Medical science is based on probabilities rather than absolute facts, and understanding this concept can help individuals regain control over their health by recognizing that scientific findings are not always definitive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2112s">(00:35:12)</a>.</li>
<li>A personal experience at a horse event, where a horse was given a hot dog to eat, challenged preconceived notions about animal behavior and highlighted the importance of questioning assumptions and considering the limitations of scientific knowledge <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2142s">(00:35:42)</a>.</li>
<li>When communicating information, it's not the telling that's the problem, but rather the receiving of the information, as people tend to take diagnoses or information as absolute truth, which can be misleading <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2185s">(00:36:25)</a>.</li>
<li>Diagnoses are not always certain, and symptoms can have multiple causes, making it unlikely that every person with a particular disease will follow the same course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2220s">(00:37:00)</a>.</li>
<li>People's understanding of probabilities is often flawed, and they tend to ask for definitive answers, even when probabilities are involved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2246s">(00:37:26)</a>.</li>
<li>Information is often given for the group, not the individual, and people need to recognize this when making decisions about their health <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2269s">(00:37:49)</a>.</li>
<li>The example of a foul shooting contest between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Langer">Ellen Langer</a> illustrates that even with high probabilities, individual outcomes can be uncertain, and people should consider multiple factors before making decisions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2280s">(00:38:00)</a>.</li>
<li>Another example, involving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> parking lot, shows that even with high-quality cars, individual outcomes can be unpredictable, and people should not take bets based on group probabilities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2351s">(00:39:11)</a>.</li>
<li>In life, people should focus on what they can control, which is their reaction to events, rather than trying to predict individual outcomes, which can never be certain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2413s">(00:40:13)</a>.</li>
<li>By recognizing the uncertainty of individual outcomes, people can learn to be happy regardless of the outcome, and care less about which way things turn out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2428s">(00:40:28)</a>.</li>
<li>Recognizing that evaluations and perceptions are in one's head, rather than in the things being evaluated, can help change one's perspective and reduce stress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2458s">(00:40:58)</a>.</li>
<li>Most things in life do not matter, and people often fail to recognize this, leading to unnecessary stress and anxiety <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2479s">(00:41:19)</a>.</li>
<li>To manage stress, it's essential to differentiate between tragedies and inconveniences, as most stressful situations are merely inconveniences <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2495s">(00:41:35)</a>.</li>
<li>When faced with a stressful situation, taking a deep breath and coming back to oneself can help put things into perspective and reduce anxiety <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2514s">(00:41:54)</a>.</li>
<li>It's never too early to learn that one's own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind">Mind</a> is often their worst enemy, and recognizing this can help individuals develop a more positive and resilient mindset <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2532s">(00:42:12)</a>.</li>
<li>With age, people often develop a greater understanding of what truly matters in life, but it's possible to teach and learn this perspective at any stage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2523s">(00:42:03)</a>.</li>

<li>Much of our developmental wiring is based on learning how to predict what's going to happen next, such as object constancy, where children eventually realize that just because an object is moved, it doesn't mean it's gone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2686s">(00:44:46)</a>.</li>

<li>The prediction-making aspect of our neural circuitry leads us to the notion of having control or wanting control, as we try to predict and prepare for outcomes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2738s">(00:45:38)</a>.</li>
<li>Mindlessness, which results from trying to hold on to things to have control, is the very thing that deprives us of control, as it ignores the changing nature of things and relationships <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2759s">(00:45:59)</a>.</li>
<li>When we meet someone, we often size them up and try to control our interactions with them, but this ignores the times the person is not like that and the ways the relationship could have otherwise grown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2775s">(00:46:15)</a>.</li>
<li>A psychological treatment for chronic illness is based on the idea that things are changing, and we're always holding them still, giving us the illusion of control <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2802s">(00:46:42)</a>.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind">Mind</a> is clearest in the morning, and the first thoughts of the day can be important, but often the mind is constantly thinking of other things that need to be done, which can be distracting and feel sad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2892s">(00:48:12)</a>.</li>
<li>This constant distraction can be seen as an asset, as being able to think of multiple things at once can be beneficial, but it can also be a hindrance when it comes to focusing on a single task <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2940s">(00:49:00)</a>.</li>
<li>Many of the "shoulds" that distract the mind are just lies and not based on actual needs or desires, but rather a contamination of useless thoughts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=2950s">(00:49:10)</a>.</li>
<li>Multitasking can be seen as either beneficial or detrimental, depending on how one perceives the tasks being performed, and it's possible to group multiple tasks as a single unit or see them as separate and conflicting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3079s">(00:51:19)</a>.</li>
<li>Focusing on a single task and giving it one's full attention can lead to greater satisfaction and productivity, as seen in the example of doing one work thing each day and putting everything into it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3021s">(00:50:21)</a>.</li>
<li>The way one perceives tasks and multitasking can affect their experience and productivity, and it's possible to reframe one's thinking to see tasks as part of a larger whole rather than separate and conflicting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3095s">(00:51:35)</a>.</li>

<li>There was a "I'll sleep when I'm dead" mindset that negatively impacted people's health, but books like Matt Walker's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep">Why We Sleep</a>" have helped shift the focus to the importance of sleep and gaining agency over one's sleep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3661s">(01:01:01)</a>.</li>
<li>Focusing too much on sleep needs can create anxiety, making it difficult to sleep, and it's essential to address the underlying reasons for sleeplessness, such as stress, rather than just the number of hours slept <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3681s">(01:01:21)</a>.</li>

<li>The Counterclockwise study involved people who were around 80 years old, which was considered old at the time, and they looked like they were not going to make it down the hall to the office, indicating their frailty <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3735s">(01:02:15)</a>.</li>
<li>The participants were coddled and presumed to have various problems, with their adult daughters often answering questions on their behalf, but as soon as they arrived at the retreat, they changed and the feeling was almost palpable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3818s">(01:03:38)</a>.</li>
<li>The first group in the study was the reminiscent group, which was a control group that would reminisce for the week, knowing the difference between the past and the present <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3835s">(01:03:55)</a>.</li>
<li>The study took place before the internet and Google, making it challenging to find music from the past to play during the van ride to the retreat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3852s">(01:04:12)</a>.</li>
<li>Due to the absence of male graduate students, the researcher had to instruct the seven old men to take charge of their own heavy suitcases, which was an unplanned task that gave them a sense of control over their lives <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3906s">(01:05:06)</a>.</li>
<li>This task made a significant difference, as the participants went from being coddled to being in charge of their own lives, and even the comparison group did well, although not as well as the other group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3940s">(01:05:40)</a>.</li>
<li>The researcher's goal was to explore possibilities and see what may be, rather than just describing what is, and the study's approach was focused on this aspect <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=3952s">(01:05:52)</a>.</li>

<li>The Esselin Institute in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sur">Big Sur</a> was founded by individuals who were previously at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University">Stanford University</a> and proposed a class on mindfulness and breathing, but were allegedly run off campus due to the cultural norms at the time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4007s">(01:06:47)</a>.</li>
<li>A study was conducted at Stanford on the effects of particular patterns of breathing on stress levels, which was a pioneering effort in the field of mindfulness and meditation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4040s">(01:07:20)</a>.</li>
<li>There has been a significant shift in the academic cultural milieu, with grants now being given for studies on meditation and mindfulness, which was not the case in the past <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4050s">(01:07:30)</a>.</li>
<li>The reception of unconventional studies on mindfulness and meditation was not always positive, but the use of established scientific methods helped to gain acceptance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4099s">(01:08:19)</a>.</li>
<li>The field of happiness and mindfulness has grown significantly, with multiple labs at Harvard now working on these topics, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Langer">Ellen Langer</a> is considered a pioneer in this field <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4121s">(01:08:41)</a>.</li>
<li>Ellen Langer's approach to thinking and research is focused on exploring unconventional ideas and questions, rather than simply following established norms <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4096s">(01:08:16)</a>.</li>
<li>As a child, Ellen Langer was naturally inclined to question and challenge assumptions, as evidenced by her reaction to being told she was a patient child at the dentist, and this mindset has continued throughout her career <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4166s">(01:09:26)</a>.</li>
<li>Ellen Langer's colleague, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Ross_(actor)">Lee Ross (actor)</a>, once described her as being "from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars">Mars</a>" due to her unconventional approach to thinking and research, but she believes that she is not that different from others <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4184s">(01:09:44)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of being from a different time or having a different perspective can influence how one views and interacts with the world, as it allows for a fresh and unconventional approach to problems and challenges <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4203s">(01:10:03)</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin">Rick Rubin</a>, a musician and author, has a unique ability to bring out the best creative works in people, and he emphasizes that the greatest impediment to the creative process is thinking about how one's work will be received by others <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4237s">(01:10:37)</a>.</li>
<li>Rubin believes that creative works should be seen as offerings to a higher power or the universe, rather than being driven by a desire for external validation or recognition <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4255s">(01:10:55)</a>.</li>
<li>The mindful body is a concept that recognizes that everything in life is subject to change and that nothing is fixed or absolute, and that by being aware of this, individuals can take control of their lives and make positive changes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4286s">(01:11:26)</a>.</li>
<li>Everything in life was at one point a decision made by people with different motives, histories, and needs, and by recognizing this, individuals can begin to see that everything is mutable and subject to change <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4291s">(01:11:31)</a>.</li>
<li>By putting people back into the equation, everything becomes changeable, and individuals can begin to see that they have the power to make positive changes in their lives <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4302s">(01:11:42)</a>.</li>
<li>The idea that everything can be changed is a powerful concept that can be applied to all areas of life, from physical health and appearance to personal relationships and career goals <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4316s">(01:11:56)</a>.</li>
<li>A key aspect of this concept is recognizing that what is, doesn't have to be, and that individuals have the power to make changes and create a different reality for themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4352s">(01:12:32)</a>.</li>
<li>Even seemingly fixed or absolute concepts, such as insurance company decisions or medical diagnoses, are ultimately made by people and are subject to change and revision <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4370s">(01:12:50)</a>.</li>
<li>Recognizing the power of individual perspective and decision-making can be a powerful tool for creating positive change in one's life and in the world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4401s">(01:13:21)</a>.</li>
<li>The idea that we should do things the same way as others is considered ridiculous, and it's essential to consider individual differences when following rules or guidelines, especially if they were created by someone with different characteristics or needs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4434s">(01:13:54)</a>.</li>
<li>Everything that exists was once a decision made by someone, and as soon as a decision is made, the uncertainty surrounding it is often forgotten, leading people to follow rules without questioning them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4465s">(01:14:25)</a>.</li>
<li>An example of this is the rules of tennis, which were decided by someone and can be changed or modified to suit individual needs, such as having three serves instead of two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4480s">(01:14:40)</a>.</li>
<li>If individuals were to create their own rules or guidelines, they would likely be more successful and confident in their abilities, as they would be tailored to their unique needs and strengths <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4514s">(01:15:14)</a>.</li>
<li>People often feel pressured to fit into predetermined forms or rules, but it's essential to appreciate that these rules were created by someone and can be changed or deviated from if they don't fit or cause harm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4551s">(01:15:51)</a>.</li>
<li>Laws and rules are not always the same as morality, and individuals should not blindly follow them if they cause harm or go against their values, citing examples of laws that have been changed or overturned, such as those related to interracial marriage and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ">LGBTQ</a> rights <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4570s">(01:16:10)</a>.</li>
<li>It's essential to live the life you want to live and not be constrained by rules or laws that don't serve you, and to be willing to deviate or fight against them if necessary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4601s">(01:16:41)</a>.</li>

<li>The laws of nature, such as physics, chemistry, and biology, are considered real, but human understanding of them can vary, and it's essential to acknowledge that there's still much to be discovered in these fields <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4715s">(01:18:35)</a>.</li>
<li>Humans create rules, and culture and group think can dictate behavior, which can be detrimental to living a more exploratory and free life <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4780s">(01:19:40)</a>.</li>
<li>The theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind">Mind</a> allows people to get into others' minds and create ideas about how they will be judged, leading to giving up some personal freedom and autonomy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4790s">(01:19:50)</a>.</li>
<li>Every behavior can be understood in equal dimensions as good or bad, and people's perceptions of others can be influenced by their values and perspectives <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4819s">(01:20:19)</a>.</li>
<li>It's impossible to control how others think, and people's values and traits can be perceived differently by others, such as being seen as gullible or flexible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4828s">(01:20:28)</a>.</li>
<li>Behavior makes sense from the actor's perspective, and denying this sense can lead to self-criticism and negative self-talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4874s">(01:21:14)</a>.</li>
<li>Realizing that behavior makes sense can increase self-acceptance and self-liking, and acknowledging different perspectives can improve relationships <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4900s">(01:21:40)</a>.</li>
<li>People often try to change aspects of themselves, but these traits can be valued in different contexts, and recognizing this can lead to greater self-respect and acceptance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=4921s">(01:22:01)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of forgiveness is explored, and it's noted that forgiveness is often seen as a positive trait, but it's also tied to blame, which can be negative <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5050s">(01:24:10)</a>.</li>
<li>Forgiveness requires blame, and people typically blame others for bad things, but these things can be neutral and only perceived as bad by those who see the world negatively <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5079s">(01:24:39)</a>.</li>
<li>Understanding why someone did something can eliminate the need for blame and forgiveness, and it's suggested that recognizing people's motivations in a more open-minded way is a better approach <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5109s">(01:25:09)</a>.</li>

<li>Humans have a unique tendency to develop technologies that often bring convenience, but also create new problems, and this drive to develop is unlikely to stop, as seen in the rapid advancements in fields like space exploration and AI <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5136s">(01:25:36)</a>.</li>
<li>This drive to develop is not limited to technology, but is a general human compulsion to create and express, which is also seen in other areas like music and art <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5266s">(01:27:46)</a>.</li>
<li>The drive to create is closely tied to the human desire to be maximally alive, and people are drawn to different areas of creation based on their individual interests <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5283s">(01:28:03)</a>.</li>
<li>The idea that creations need to have durability in time is a social construction, and some cultures, like the Asian monks mentioned, create art that is intentionally ephemeral <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5331s">(01:28:51)</a>.</li>
<li>The act of creation is often done for its own sake, rather than for the purpose of leaving a lasting legacy, as seen in the example of building sand castles without taking a selfie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5352s">(01:29:12)</a>.</li>
<li>The human generative spirit is a unique aspect of human nature, and is not seen to the same extent in other animals, although some animals, like crows, do exhibit problem-solving abilities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5247s">(01:27:27)</a>.</li>
<li>The drive to develop and create is not necessarily driven by a desire to overcome nature, but rather to work with nature and express human capabilities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5190s">(01:26:30)</a>.</li>
<li>The development of technologies has brought many benefits, but also creates new challenges, and humans will likely continue to develop new technologies to address these challenges <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5161s">(01:26:01)</a>.</li>
<li>The example of Elon Musk's efforts to colonize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars">Mars</a> is cited as an example of human ingenuity and the drive to push beyond current limitations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5206s">(01:26:46)</a>.</li>
<li>A mindfulness practice involves getting out what one feels they need to get out, and it's just a practice, as seen in the example of building a sandcastle, where the focus is on the process, not the end result <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5360s">(01:29:20)</a>.</li>
<li>Losing an entire draft of a book can be frustrating, but it's possible to view it as an opportunity to create something new and potentially better, rather than getting attached to the original draft <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5394s">(01:29:54)</a>.</li>
<li>When writing research papers, the focus often shifts from the number of publications to the quality of the work, which can be freeing and allow for more excitement and engagement in the process <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5426s">(01:30:26)</a>.</li>
<li>Recognizing that excitement and engagement can be found in any activity by simply noticing new things can make life feel differently and more enjoyable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5448s">(01:30:48)</a>.</li>
<li>An experiment was conducted where people who didn't like certain activities, such as rap music or football, were asked to notice new things about them, and the more they noticed, the more they liked the activity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5460s">(01:31:00)</a>.</li>
<li>Noticing new things can increase enjoyment and engagement, and it's a simple yet effective way to find excitement in life <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5494s">(01:31:34)</a>.</li>

<li>The idea of switching venues and possibly changing identities is intriguing, and art is an interesting example of this concept, as it allows for a different form of expression and creativity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5570s">(01:32:50)</a>.</li>
<li>The speaker started painting at the age of 50, despite being told as a child that they had no artistic ability, highlighting the limitations that people often place on others and themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5596s">(01:33:16)</a>.</li>
<li>The experience of being told they couldn't draw led to a realization that people often think they know how things should be done and who can or can't do them, which is a limiting and mindless approach <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5622s">(01:33:42)</a>.</li>
<li>A friend's comment on an early painting, saying "there's something there," was important, but the response was more significant, as it acknowledged that quality is a decision people make, and there is no absolute standard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5652s">(01:34:12)</a>.</li>
<li>This idea is also reflected in the art world, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism">Impressionism</a>, for example, were rejected in their day but are now highly valued, highlighting the subjective nature of quality and talent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5696s">(01:34:56)</a>.</li>
<li>Being present and mindful while creating something can reveal itself in the work, and putting oneself into the work is what makes it great fun and exhilarating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5710s">(01:35:10)</a>.</li>
<li>The education system is seen as a major contributor to mindlessness, as it often teaches absolutes and limits people's potential, and a more mindful approach to education is needed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5745s">(01:35:45)</a>.</li>
<li>The problems people face, both personally and globally, are often the indirect or direct result of mindlessness, and acknowledging that everyone has different knowledge and abilities could help solve these problems <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5773s">(01:36:13)</a>.</li>
<li>Grading papers and evaluating people's work based on absolute standards is limiting and can be distasteful, as it assumes that everyone would evaluate things in the same way <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5821s">(01:37:01)</a>.</li>
<li>The idea that everyone knows something different and can do something different is essential to recognize, and acknowledging this could help create a more mindful and inclusive approach to education and life <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5812s">(01:36:52)</a>.</li>
<li>Research has shown that self-testing is one of the most effective ways to learn, as it enhances recall and depth of consolidation, but it should be done for the sake of learning, not evaluation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5842s">(01:37:22)</a>.</li>
<li>When testing people, the person deciding what is important to know often ignores other things the student may know, which can be limiting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5885s">(01:38:05)</a>.</li>
<li>Everyone has a unique perspective that can add to the larger picture, regardless of their position or status, as seen in the example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabana_boy">Cabana boy</a> who noticed the unused hotel space <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5921s">(01:38:41)</a>.</li>
<li>Awards and titles, such as "genius" or Nobel prizes, can be limiting and may not necessarily lead to further achievements, as people may become more focused on fundraising and less on producing new work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5955s">(01:39:15)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of a hierarchy of knowledge, where some people are considered to be on top and know more, can be restrictive and ignore the value of diverse perspectives <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5934s">(01:38:54)</a>.</li>
<li>The idea of self-testing and valuing diverse perspectives can be applied to learning and personal growth, allowing individuals to take a more active role in their own development <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5862s">(01:37:42)</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Labels and categories can hide ambiguity and create artificial differences between individuals, as seen in the example of a student receiving an 89 versus a 90 on a test, which can lead to vastly different perceptions and opportunities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=5970s">(01:39:30)</a>.</li>
<li>The "borderline effect" refers to the phenomenon where individuals who score just below or above a certain threshold are placed into different categories, despite the lack of meaningful differences between them, which can have significant consequences for their lives and opportunities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6020s">(01:40:20)</a>.</li>
<li>This effect is not limited to academic or professional settings, but also applies to medical diagnoses, where individuals who score just below or above a certain threshold may be classified as having or not having a disease, despite the lack of meaningful differences between them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6072s">(01:41:12)</a>.</li>
<li>The use of labels and categories can be limiting and constraining, as it can create artificial boundaries and expectations that can affect an individual's behavior and potential <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6141s">(01:42:21)</a>.</li>
<li>A study was conducted where a videotape of a person being interviewed was shown to therapists, who were either told that the person was a patient or a job applicant, and the results showed that the therapists' perceptions of the person's mental health and adjustment varied significantly depending on the label used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6160s">(01:42:40)</a>.</li>
<li>The words "I am" can be particularly powerful and limiting, as they can constrain an individual's notions of what is possible and what is not possible, and can have a significant impact on their behavior and potential <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6211s">(01:43:31)</a>.</li>
<li>A military operative and his teammates had a mindset of being adaptive, which allowed them to be very flexible in their operations, and they had to completely wipe away their sense of identity except when it related to being adaptive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6232s">(01:43:52)</a>.</li>
<li>This mindset is interesting as it shows how identity shapes and constrains one's mindset, and how it can be converted into action or failure to execute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6269s">(01:44:29)</a>.</li>
<li>When learning something new, people often assume they will be the same person in the future, but this is not the case, and this assumption can limit their potential <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6293s">(01:44:53)</a>.</li>
<li>As people age, their performance in certain activities may not be as good as it could be because they are trying to do things the same way they did when they were younger, rather than taking advantage of the positive changes that come with age <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6330s">(01:45:30)</a>.</li>
<li>Experience can be beneficial in certain tasks, but it's not always necessary to have the same skills as when you first started, and freezing one's behavior can limit their potential <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6361s">(01:46:01)</a>.</li>
<li>People often learn something new and then freeze their behavior, doing things the same way for the rest of their life, even if it's no longer the most effective way <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6374s">(01:46:14)</a>.</li>
<li>This is illustrated by the example of driving on ice, where the recommended action has changed over time, but many people still follow the old advice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6405s">(01:46:45)</a>.</li>
<li>The way people learn things is often based on the current situation, and they may not receive updates or new information, leading to outdated and potentially unsafe behavior <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6445s">(01:47:25)</a>.</li>
<li>It's essential to understand that things are constantly changing, and people need to be aware of these changes to adapt and improve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6464s">(01:47:44)</a>.</li>
<li>Paying attention to changes and adapting to them can make it easier to cope with the concept of identity and age, as holding onto a fixed sense of self can make it harder to change and accept new experiences <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6470s">(01:47:50)</a>.</li>
<li>Age is not a relevant factor for some people, and they may not have a sense of their own age, as seen in the example of helping someone and not feeling a significant age difference <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6486s">(01:48:06)</a>.</li>
<li>Research has shown that people's perception of age can be influenced by their environment, and being aware of age can sometimes be beneficial, but not always <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6514s">(01:48:34)</a>.</li>
<li>Clothing can be a factor in how people perceive age, with certain styles being considered more or less suitable for certain age groups <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6534s">(01:48:54)</a>.</li>
<li>Wearing uniforms can eliminate age-relevant cues, as people who wear the same uniform for many years do not display visible signs of aging, and research has shown that people in these situations tend to be healthier <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6555s">(01:49:15)</a>.</li>

<li>As people age, they may start to think about their physical limitations, such as not being able to climb stairs, which can accelerate their decline in locomotor ability by focusing on negative thoughts and finding evidence to support them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6658s">(01:50:58)</a>.</li>
<li>When older individuals forget something, they tend to pay more attention to the forgetting, making it worse, whereas younger people tend to forget and move on without dwelling on it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6697s">(01:51:37)</a>.</li>
<li>The loss of memory with age may not be entirely due to memory itself, but rather due to a lack of interest or motivation to learn and remember new information <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6744s">(01:52:24)</a>.</li>
<li>Forgetting can serve a purpose, as it allows people to experience new things and not be overwhelmed by remembering everything <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6804s">(01:53:24)</a>.</li>
<li>The idea that people become hard of hearing as they age may be related to the realization that much of what people say is not important, and being hard of hearing can protect one from unnecessary noise <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6824s">(01:53:44)</a>.</li>
<li>The speaker reflects on their own experience with vision, noting that their distance vision is sharp, but their close-up vision has diminished with age, leading them to use glasses and adjust their reading habits <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6845s">(01:54:05)</a>.</li>
<li>The speaker attributes their understanding of the changes in their vision to their knowledge of neuroplasticity, which allows them to adapt and find ways to compensate for their declining vision <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6876s">(01:54:36)</a>.</li>
<li>The idea that vision has to get worse with age is not necessarily true, and there are instances where this is not the case <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6954s">(01:55:54)</a>.</li>
<li>A study was conducted using the Snellen eye chart, but instead of the letters getting smaller, they got larger, which changed the expectation and allowed people to see what they couldn't before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6917s">(01:55:17)</a>.</li>
<li>The traditional vision test is bizarre, as in real life, people rarely look at letters that make no sense, and other factors like hunger and color can affect what they can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=6965s">(01:56:05)</a>.</li>
<li>Wearing glasses can create a dependence on them, similar to taking a laxative, and people should try to see without them to understand when they can and can't see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7004s">(01:56:44)</a>.</li>
<li>Holding things still when they're varying is a common mistake, and acknowledging variability can give people control over their physical well-being, which is related to mindfulness <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7020s">(01:57:00)</a>.</li>
<li>Mindfulness is about noticing change and being aware of variability, which can help people understand their physical limitations and make changes to improve their well-being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7075s">(01:57:55)</a>.</li>
<li>Paying attention to variability can help people identify patterns and make changes to improve their vision, such as taking a nap or eating an energy bar when their vision is worse <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7065s">(01:57:45)</a>.</li>
<li>By acknowledging and working with variability, people can take control of their physical well-being and make positive changes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7069s">(01:57:49)</a>.</li>
<li>Chronic illnesses are often misunderstood as conditions that cannot be improved, but this is not necessarily true; the term "chronic" simply means that the medical world does not have a fix, not that nothing can be done to alleviate symptoms <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7139s">(01:58:59)</a>.</li>
<li>Symptoms of chronic illnesses can vary over time, sometimes getting better and sometimes getting worse, similar to the stock market, which does not move in a straight line <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7168s">(01:59:28)</a>.</li>

<li>Engaging in a mindful search for reasons why symptoms are better or worse at a given time can lead to increased mindfulness, which has been shown to be beneficial for health <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7216s">(02:00:16)</a>.</li>
<li>Asking individuals with chronic illnesses to periodically report on their symptoms and why they think they are better or worse can lead to positive results, as seen in studies on multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, Parkinson's, and stroke <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7231s">(02:00:31)</a>.</li>
<li>This approach has no negative side effects and does not require individuals to stop their medical treatments, but rather empowers them to take charge of their own healthcare <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7250s">(02:00:50)</a>.</li>

<li>People often create theories by working backwards, taking what is and deriving rules to explain why it has to be that way, which can limit their ability to think outside those boundaries <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7378s">(02:02:58)</a>.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic brought about two major controversies: the effectiveness of wearing masks and the use of vaccines, both of which have valid arguments for and against them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7608s">(02:06:48)</a>.</li>
<li>Masks can prevent non-verbal communication, which is crucial for people's health and well-being, while vaccines may not be suitable for everyone due to individual differences in reactions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7642s">(02:07:22)</a>.</li>
<li>Recognizing the uncertainty inherent in these issues can lead to a more nuanced approach, rather than mandating a single solution, and acknowledging that there are multiple perspectives and potential consequences <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7673s">(02:07:53)</a>.</li>
<li>In the medical world, acknowledging uncertainty can lead to a more humble approach and a greater appreciation for differing opinions, as seen in a talk given to 5,000 women with breast cancer and physicians <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=7702s">(02:08:22)</a>.</li>

<li>A student shares an experience where she wore two different shoes and was questioned by a stranger in an elevator, and she responded by mirroring the stranger's actions, highlighting the idea that everything is "up for grabs" and that people's opinions don't really matter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8211s">(02:16:51)</a>.</li>
<li>Recognizing that people's opinions and judgments are subjective can be freeing, and it's possible to learn this lesson at a young age by understanding that people will have different reactions to the same behavior <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8264s">(02:17:44)</a>.</li>
<li>It's emphasized that it's impossible to control how others perceive and define one's behavior, and that it's not possible to please everyone due to individual perspectives and definitions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8292s">(02:18:12)</a>.</li>

<li>A recent news story incorrectly reported that a famous person's home was destroyed in the LA fires, when in fact it was the speaker's home, complete with a photograph of the home and the speaker's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_4Runner">Toyota 4Runner</a> parked in the driveway <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8299s">(02:18:19)</a>.</li>
<li>The speaker was upset not because the story didn't mention their name, but because the entire story was fabricated, and the reporter had not attempted to fact-check the information <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8335s">(02:18:55)</a>.</li>
<li>The speaker realized that this was not an isolated incident and that probably half or more of what is read in the traditional popular press is made up, with no one fact-checking the information <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8390s">(02:19:50)</a>.</li>
<li>The speaker's sense of justice was frustrated by the incident, but they decided not to pursue it legally, instead finding it ridiculous and an example of humans being silly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8405s">(02:20:05)</a>.</li>
<li>The speaker believes that much of what grabs our attention and the drama of things is just humans being ridiculous, sometimes lying or pretending to serve justice when it's actually serving themselves or other interests <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8439s">(02:20:39)</a>.</li>

<li>The speaker has come to appreciate the idea that once you start looking, you can see that much of human behavior is like theater, whether it's made up or not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8511s">(02:21:51)</a>.</li>
<li>A person realized they were being ridiculous for being upset about a news article incorrectly featuring their home, as it was an honest mistake and not a personal attack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8516s">(02:21:56)</a>.</li>

<li>Life-changing events can serve as a catalyst for people to re-evaluate their lives and make positive changes, but it's unfortunate that many individuals require such events to prompt them to live more mindfully <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8747s">(02:25:47)</a>.</li>
<li>People who experience life-threatening events, such as heart attacks or strokes, often undergo a significant shift in perspective, realizing that life is not infinite and that they should start living more fully <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8770s">(02:26:10)</a>.</li>
<li>The experience of losing loved ones, such as the speaker's postdoctoral advisers, can also have a profound impact on one's perspective on life and mortality <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8795s">(02:26:35)</a>.</li>
<li>Celebrations of life, such as the one held for the speaker's adviser Ben, can be a powerful way to acknowledge the importance of living in the present and appreciating the people and experiences that bring joy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8820s">(02:27:00)</a>.</li>
<li>The speaker's adviser Ben, who passed away from pancreatic cancer, had a remarkable attitude towards death, stating that if he had known how celebrated he would be, he would have died earlier, and that he would have done things differently, such as eating more sushi and ice cream <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8838s">(02:27:18)</a>.</li>
<li>Many people are not afraid of death itself, but rather the pain and loss of control that often accompany it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8879s">(02:27:59)</a>.</li>
<li>The speaker has found that older people, in general, are not afraid of death, and instead, often view living as a source of joy and fun <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8892s">(02:28:12)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of spontaneous remissions, where people experience unexpected recoveries from illnesses, is not well-studied in the medical world, but the speaker believes that these events are more common than acknowledged and can offer hope to people <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8922s">(02:28:42)</a>.</li>
<li>The attention given to an illness can make it a self-fulfilling prophecy, and if people believe that a disease like cancer is a killer, it can become a death sentence, as the body learns to give up on life-sustaining activities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=8980s">(02:29:40)</a>.</li>
<li>The will to live is a significant factor in one's health, and people who think they're going to die may not engage in activities that keep them alive, such as exercise <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9006s">(02:30:06)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of "super agers" is misleading, as it implies that their abilities are not available to others, but in reality, everyone has the potential to maintain cognitive function into later age <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9022s">(02:30:22)</a>.</li>
<li>The anterior midcingulate cortex is a brain area available to everyone, which is activated when people embrace new forms of learning and challenges, and it correlates with maintaining cognitive function into later age <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9055s">(02:30:55)</a>.</li>
<li>This brain area is linked to the dopamine reward circuitry and other circuitries, tying it to the notion of the will to live being related to embracing new learnings or challenges <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9072s">(02:31:12)</a>.</li>
<li>A story about a mental facility, known as the "Hopeless Ward," illustrates the impact of environment and mindset on health, as many unexpected deaths occurred when patients were returned to their old rooms after renovation, suggesting that the environment and mindset can affect one's will to live <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9091s">(02:31:31)</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>A "Mindful Hospital" concept is proposed, which would be different from traditional hospitals, with the goal of reducing stress and promoting mindfulness from the ground up, and efforts are being made to establish such a hospital in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>, starting with a mindful emergency ward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9134s">(02:32:14)</a>.</li>
<li>Stress is considered a major killer, and it is believed that stress levels can predict the course of a disease, such as cancer, over and above factors like nutrition, genetics, and treatment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9205s">(02:33:25)</a>.</li>
<li>Hospitals can be stressful environments, not only for patients but also for staff, who often suffer from burnout, which can be mitigated by promoting mindfulness <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9224s">(02:33:44)</a>.</li>
<li>Burnout can be prevented by being mindful and noticing new things, rather than going through the motions, and this can be achieved through simple techniques <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9237s">(02:33:57)</a>.</li>
<li>A "mindful checklist" is proposed, which goes beyond a traditional checklist by requiring the user to be present and mindful, rather than just ticking off boxes, and this can help prevent errors and improve relationships <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9283s">(02:34:43)</a>.</li>
<li>A mindful checklist would require the user to actually look at the person or situation and notice details, rather than just answering yes or no questions, and this can help the person being cared for feel noticed and cared for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9354s">(02:35:54)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of a mindful checklist is inspired by the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atul_Gawande">Atul Gawande</a>, who has written about the importance of checklists in surgery, but the mindful checklist takes this idea a step further by incorporating mindfulness and presence <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9266s">(02:34:26)</a>.</li>
<li>The use of mindful checklists can help prevent errors, such as the plane crash that occurred when pilots failed to notice that the de-icer was turned off, despite going through the motions of a traditional checklist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9330s">(02:35:30)</a>.</li>

<li>Recognizing the power of observation and asking questions is essential, as it allows individuals to notice changes and subtleties that might otherwise go unnoticed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9392s">(02:36:32)</a>.</li>
<li>When interacting with someone who appears to be forgetful, it's crucial to attend to the times when they remember, rather than just focusing on their forgetfulness, to gain a more accurate understanding of their abilities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9420s">(02:37:00)</a>.</li>
<li>By paying attention to the circumstances surrounding forgetfulness, individuals can identify patterns and gain insight into the underlying causes, rather than simply attributing it to a catch-all diagnosis like dementia <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9453s">(02:37:33)</a>.</li>
<li>Focusing on what's not changing or what's going well can be just as important as attending to what's wrong, as it can lead to a more balanced and nuanced understanding of a situation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9530s">(02:38:50)</a>.</li>

<li>Recognizing that every experience is subjective and provides opportunities for growth and learning can be freeing, but it requires embracing the idea that there is no one "right" answer or choice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9615s">(02:40:15)</a>.</li>
<li>Having many choices can feel overwhelming, but this feeling is often rooted in the implicit belief that there is a right or wrong choice; recognizing that all choices are equal can make decision-making easier <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9650s">(02:40:50)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of "Choose Your Own Adventure" can be applied to life, where individuals can view their experiences as opportunities for growth and adventure, rather than being limited by circumstances <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9664s">(02:41:04)</a>.</li>

<li>The idea of coddling is linked to the book "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coddling_of_the_American_Mind">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Haidt">Jonathan Haidt</a>, which explores the anxious generation and the impact of being constantly told about disorders and threats <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9702s">(02:41:42)</a>.</li>
<li>The over-prescription of medication in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> is mentioned, particularly antidepressants, and the potential value of these medications is acknowledged, but also the argument that they are over-prescribed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9729s">(02:42:09)</a>.</li>
<li>The impact of social media on children and teenagers is discussed, with the suggestion that they may be perfectly capable of navigating the online landscape, but are instead being told they are fragile and struggling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9770s">(02:42:50)</a>.</li>

<li>An analogy is made to the argument about violence on TV and its impact on children, suggesting that the medium is not the message, but rather the way it is used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9813s">(02:43:33)</a>.</li>
<li>The idea that technology is not inherently good or bad, but rather depends on how it is used, is discussed, with the suggestion that mindful use of technology can be beneficial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9845s">(02:44:05)</a>.</li>
<li>Data showing that college kids who use a lot of social media have lower self-esteem is presented, but the speaker argues that this is not a reason to get off social media, but rather to be more mindful of how it is used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9864s">(02:44:24)</a>.</li>
<li>The speaker suggests that people should be more authentic on social media, posting pictures that show their imperfections, rather than just presenting a curated version of themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9888s">(02:44:48)</a>.</li>
<li>Social media platforms provide a literal score for performance in terms of what other people think, by giving followers and likes, which can train circuits very robustly, but may not reflect the true value of a person or their actions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=9924s">(02:45:24)</a>.</li>
<li>People who appear to be poor may actually be wealthy, and those who appear wealthy may be hiding their true wealth, making it harder to discern who has what, except at the extremes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10002s">(02:46:42)</a>.</li>
<li>The way people present themselves, such as through their clothing or accessories, is no longer a reliable indicator of their values or group affiliations, as these signs have become leveled and are no longer distinctive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10060s">(02:47:40)</a>.</li>
<li>When people are asked why someone is dressed a certain way or doing something, they are often given a single answer, but there may be multiple reasons and meanings behind their actions, and recognizing these multiple levels can lead to more interesting and nuanced conversations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10077s">(02:47:57)</a>.</li>
<li>The ability to recognize and understand multiple levels of meaning and motivation can help to avoid pigeonholing people and allow for more open and engaging interactions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10092s">(02:48:12)</a>.</li>
<li>The use of credit has changed the way people present themselves, as those who may not have been able to afford certain things in the past can now do so, making it harder to discern who has what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10015s">(02:46:55)</a>.</li>

<li>Even mundane tasks like flossing teeth can be made more enjoyable by turning them into a game or finding ways to make them more engaging <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10518s">(02:55:18)</a>.</li>
<li>A product called Wego was created to train children to use the toilet by adding chemicals to urine that change color, making the process a fun and gamified experience for kids <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10563s">(02:56:03)</a>.</li>
<li>Gamifying tasks and activities can be a great way to make parenting more enjoyable, and it can also bring back nostalgic memories of childhood imagination <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10601s">(02:56:41)</a>.</li>
<li>The world often teaches people to separate work and play into distinct categories, but it's possible to find enjoyment and mindfulness in work, eliminating the need for a vacation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10639s">(02:57:19)</a>.</li>
<li>If someone feels they need a vacation, it may be a sign that they're working mindlessly, and it's essential to find ways to make work more enjoyable or consider a different path <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10657s">(02:57:37)</a>.</li>
<li>For those who feel they can't afford to enjoy their work due to financial constraints, it's possible to make any task more enjoyable by turning it into a game or finding ways to make it more engaging <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10685s">(02:58:05)</a>.</li>
<li>Simple activities like getting down on all fours to see the world from a different perspective or trying to navigate the day without hearing can be fun and help people appreciate their senses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10708s">(02:58:28)</a>.</li>
<li>A proposed idea for a building that simulates old age was intended to help people appreciate their abilities and expand them before it's too late, but it was met with resistance from 50-year-olds who didn't want to imagine being 80 years old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10723s">(02:58:43)</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>A study on healing and time perception was conducted where participants were inflicted with a minor wound and placed in front of a clock that was either going twice as fast, half as fast, or at real time, unbeknownst to them, and it was found that the wound healed based on clock time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10758s">(02:59:18)</a>.</li>
<li>The healing time of a wound is often perceived to be fixed, but in reality, it can vary greatly from person to person, and the way a doctor communicates the expected healing time can influence the patient's recovery <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10817s">(03:00:17)</a>.</li>
<li>If a doctor gives a specific time frame for healing, the patient may organize themselves to heal within that time frame, whereas if the doctor says they don't know the exact healing time, it can lead to a more open-ended and potentially faster recovery <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10846s">(03:00:46)</a>.</li>
<li>There are advantages to not healing quickly, such as exercising the opposite side of the brain when using the non-dominant hand, which can be beneficial for cognitive function <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10878s">(03:01:18)</a>.</li>
<li>Research is being conducted on the effects of using the non-dominant hand, with an awareness of doing so, on brain function and plasticity, building on the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize">Nobel Prize</a> winners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_H._Hubel">David H. Hubel</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsten_Wiesel">Torsten Wiesel</a> on brain plasticity and critical periods of vision <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10968s">(03:02:48)</a>.</li>
<li>Research by Mike Merenik and Greg Recken at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco">University of California, San Francisco</a> in the 80s and early 2000s showed significant brain plasticity in adult humans, contradicting the prevailing doctrine at the time that brain plasticity shuts down in adulthood <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=10980s">(03:03:00)</a>.</li>
<li>In their studies, subjects were asked to pay attention to changes in the coarseness of bumps on a rotating drum or changes in the frequency of a tone, and the areas of the brain responsible for touch and hearing were found to expand and change over time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11001s">(03:03:21)</a>.</li>
<li>The studies demonstrated that it is not just behavior, but the combination of behavior and awareness of changes in perception that drives adult plasticity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11054s">(03:04:14)</a>.</li>
<li>Awareness is considered the gate to brain change, and this concept fits with the idea that our minds play a significant role in controlling our physical health and longevity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11067s">(03:04:27)</a>.</li>
<li>Doctors have a significant influence over patients' perceptions of their health, and their predictions of healing time can become self-fulfilling prophecies, making it essential for doctors to be responsible with the information they provide <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11079s">(03:04:39)</a>.</li>
<li>The norms used to predict healing time are often based on outdated studies, and people's lifestyles, diets, and environments have changed significantly over the years, making these norms less relevant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11102s">(03:05:02)</a>.</li>
<li>When people receive a diagnosis, they should be aware that the information is often based on old studies, and they should not take the predicted outcomes as absolute, but rather as a starting point for imagining possibilities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11133s">(03:05:33)</a>.</li>
<li>Using the non-dominant hand or adapting to new situations, such as breaking a leg, can be opportunities for growth and change, and attending to these experiences can be beneficial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11169s">(03:06:09)</a>.</li>
<li>The story of a woman with no arms who learned to slice food with a knife between her toes is an example of the human capacity for adaptation and growth <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11197s">(03:06:37)</a>.</li>
<li>The person has seen and done a lot of things over the years, but remembering specific details can be challenging <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11206s">(03:06:46)</a>.</li>
<li>Even when taught to do something in a single way, it can be more enjoyable to learn multiple methods <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11218s">(03:06:58)</a>.</li>

<li>A deficit model of life exists, where people tend to work harder to avoid a loss than to gain something, and this mindset can be limiting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11232s">(03:07:12)</a>.</li>
<li>It's essential to see the gain in a so-called loss or the loss in a so-called gain, which can lead to a different perspective on the world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11266s">(03:07:46)</a>.</li>
<li>When dealing with rejections or negative feedback, it's crucial to allow oneself to feel the emotions acutely and then move on quickly, rather than dwelling on them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11312s">(03:08:32)</a>.</li>
<li>Creating a long arc of positive feedback loops can help in maintaining motivation and resilience, especially when faced with rejections or setbacks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11301s">(03:08:21)</a>.</li>
<li>Reviews and critical feedback should be seen as opportunities for growth and improvement, rather than as negative or personal attacks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11385s">(03:09:45)</a>.</li>
<li>It's essential to recognize that reviews and feedback are opinions rather than statements of fact, and that they can be used to improve and refine one's work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11451s">(03:10:51)</a>.</li>
<li>Papers or ideas that are not accepted today may be accepted tomorrow, and it's essential to be open to change and evolution in one's field <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11481s">(03:11:21)</a>.</li>
<li>Maintaining a sense of perfection can be limiting, and it's essential to be open to imperfections and mistakes as opportunities for growth and learning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11402s">(03:10:02)</a>.</li>
<li>Presenting oneself as a "Fabergé egg" – perfect and flawless – can be problematic, as it creates unrealistic expectations and can lead to disappointment and frustration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11416s">(03:10:16)</a>.</li>
<li>Recognizing that feedback and reviews are not personal attacks, but rather opportunities for growth, can help in developing a more resilient and adaptive mindset <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11462s">(03:11:02)</a>.</li>

<li>Addiction can be seen as a progressive narrowing of the things that bring someone pleasure, while enlightenment, if it exists, could be viewed as a progressive broadening of the things that bring us pleasure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11522s">(03:12:02)</a>.</li>
<li>A key aspect of this broadening is the ability to look at things from multiple perspectives, taking on other points of view while holding onto one's own perceptions, and being open to challenging preconceived notions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11552s">(03:12:32)</a>.</li>
<li>This flexibility of thinking and expansiveness can lead to a more powerful and easier way of living, where one can appreciate individual talents and not be afraid of others <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11578s">(03:12:58)</a>.</li>
<li>Recognizing that behavior makes sense can lead to a different view of people, where individuals are not categorized as good or bad, and everyone's talents are appreciated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11620s">(03:13:40)</a>.</li>
<li>This mindset can make life easier and nicer, allowing one to be trusting of people and not afraid of potential harm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11654s">(03:14:14)</a>.</li>
<li>Letting go of the need to evaluate oneself constantly and not caring about things that one is implicitly or explicitly taught to care about can be very freeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11698s">(03:14:58)</a>.</li>
<li>It is possible to live a life where stress is not seen as necessary, and one does not believe they are better or worse than anyone else <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11758s">(03:15:58)</a>.</li>
<li>The concept of self-worth is often tied to external factors such as wealth, academic achievements, and social status, but it's essential to recognize that these measures are not a true reflection of one's value as a person <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11773s">(03:16:13)</a>.</li>
<li>People engage in various activities to feel good about themselves, but it's crucial to understand that self-acceptance and self-worth come from within, and one should not rely on external validation to like themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11803s">(03:16:43)</a>.</li>
<li>A person's likability is not dependent on external factors, and recognizing this can lead to a more fulfilling life and help others as well <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYAgf_lfio4&amp;t=11815s">(03:16:55)</a>.</li>
