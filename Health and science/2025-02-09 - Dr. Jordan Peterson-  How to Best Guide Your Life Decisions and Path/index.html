  <h1>2025 02 09   Dr. Jordan Peterson   How to Best Guide Your Life Decisions and Path</h1>

<h2 id="dr-jordan-peterson-0000">Dr. Jordan Peterson 00:00<a class="headerlink" href="#dr-jordan-peterson-0000" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dr. Jordan Peterson is a psychologist, author, and influential public intellectual who discusses the human animal and what it means to be a human being at the level of psychology, neuroscience, and expression of different personality types 00:14.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most people do not think about having different personalities, but due to the activity of specific brain circuitries, including the <a href="/item/bc549722-18db-451e-b33c-b5fe93e84846">hypothalamus</a> and <a href="/item/903675ee-1aa2-4852-9e39-845d0462982c">prefrontal cortex</a>, individuals can adopt different states of mind that influence emotions, thoughts, and actions 00:38.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This discussion is both intellectual and practical, covering topics such as the relationship between the Call to Adventure and responsibility, the use of story to understand oneself, and guiding actions towards positive outcomes 00:59.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Peterson emphasizes the use of story, particularly biblical stories, to understand oneself and guide actions, as discussed in his new book "We Who Wrestle with <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">God</a>" 01:09.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conversation also explores self, romantic relationships, commitments, family, community, culture, media, politics, cancel culture, social media, pornography, and shifting masculine and feminine roles 01:26.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Peterson discusses the innate human drive to create action at a distance, both in space and in time, and how to use different sources of story, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience to understand and guide decision-making 01:42.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He highlights the tight relationship between the Call to Adventure and responsibility as a trustable framework for moving forward in life towards one's best possible outcomes 02:03.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the end of the discussion, listeners will have a better understanding of their neural circuits, psychology, and different states of mind, as well as tools and frameworks to apply this knowledge towards achieving the best possible outcomes 02:12.  </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The brain can be broken down into basic features, including autonomic physiology, which regulates sleepiness, wakefulness, breathing, and heart rate, and runs in the background 05:51.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The brain also has circuitry devoted to impulses, which include desires, repetitive behaviors, and things to avoid, such as pain or putrid things 06:10.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impulses can be characterized as a fundamental aspect of human behavior, but this characterization comes with a price, and it's crucial to explore this concept further 06:33.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The brain has executive function, or prefrontal circuitry, which enables top-down suppression of impulses, allowing for self-inhibition and the ability to push oneself into things that would otherwise be aversive 06:45.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of suppression and inhibition is also worth exploring, as it presents a parallel problem to the notion of impulse 07:06.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The brain has default settings, established by both nature and nurture, which determine how one operates in the world with respect to food, other people, oneself, and thoughts 07:35.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These default settings can be intervened with and rewired through neuroplasticity, an incredible gift that humans possess, allowing for changes to be made throughout life 08:07.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">God</a> and multiple religions may be a consequence of humans realizing that their natural equipment is insufficient to allow them to evolve as a species and be the best version of themselves 08:37.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The central question of life is to what extent one needs to intervene with their default settings, rewire them, and engage the <a href="/item/903675ee-1aa2-4852-9e39-845d0462982c">prefrontal cortex</a> to push down on repetitive or aversive behaviors 09:04.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human neural circuitry is not sufficient to navigate life effectively, and a rule book or set of guidelines is necessary to make the best decisions and achieve success 09:28.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/item/03f4eae7-ed6c-47d2-ad43-7f9c033038d0">Socialization</a> plays a crucial role in shaping behavior, and the 25-year socialization window is a complex process that helps individuals learn from others and their traditions 09:45.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="/item/3f889c82-eabf-477e-afbe-7b11f5635957">socialization process</a> involves integrating lower-order motivational states and impulses into a sustainable, voluntary structure that regulates them and gives them their proper place 10:53.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This integration is different from an inhibition model, which is unsophisticated and only suppresses impulses, whereas integration allows individuals to subordinate their impulses to higher-order goals 11:04.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A good example of integration is a team athlete who subordinates their aggression to a higher-order goal, enabling them to be successful in a maximally social and sustainable way 12:13.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of integration is better than inhibition, as it allows individuals to achieve their goals while still being assertive and aggressive when necessary 11:58.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The behavioral literature, derived from animal experiments, has limitations in explaining human behavior, particularly at the highest strata of human endeavor 13:05.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theory of chain reflexes, which is deterministic, has been successful in explaining some aspects of behavior but is insufficient to explain complex human behavior 12:59.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of motivational states was misunderstood in the behavioral literature, and a more nuanced understanding is necessary to explain human behavior 13:13.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distinction between Freud's inhibition model and P's integration model highlights the importance of integrating lower-order impulses into a sustainable, voluntary structure 10:50.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower-order motivational states are insufficiently described as impulses or drives, as this fails to account for their effect on perception 13:16.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is more effective to consider these states as motivated states, which integrates behavioral theory with psychoanalytic theory, particularly the psychoanalytic theory of religious endeavor 13:30.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower-order motivational states can be viewed as subpersonalities or personalities with their own perceptions, objects of perception, cognitive rationalizations, and emotions 13:42.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These subpersonalities are unidimensional, narrow-minded, and can be seen in cases of addiction, where they have a significant impact on an individual's behavior and decision-making 13:56.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering lower-order motivational states as personalities rather than impulses provides a more comprehensive understanding of human motivation and behavior 14:06.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personalities-motivation-1408">Personalities, Motivation 14:08<a class="headerlink" href="#personalities-motivation-1408" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Personalities can be thought of as consisting of multiple subpersonalities, and a healthy personality integrates these subpersonalities without inhibiting them, allowing for the expression of lower-order motivational states such as aggression and sexuality in a controlled manner 14:08.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 2-year-old's personality can be seen as a succession of dominion of subpersonalities, and as a person grows, they need to build an integrating personality on top of these subpersonalities 14:23.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/item/03f4eae7-ed6c-47d2-ad43-7f9c033038d0">Socialization</a> plays a crucial role in shaping a person's personality, and it's essential to integrate lower-order motivational states into the functioning ego, rather than simply inhibiting them 14:49.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of disciplinary strategies like timeout can be effective in teaching children to control their impulses, but it's essential to consider whether this is promoting inhibition or the development of a superordinate personality 15:30.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of a superordinate personality involves the integration of lower-order motivational states into a hierarchy, allowing for the expression of these states in a controlled and socially acceptable manner 16:14.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The human organism can be seen as coming into the world with a "battleground" of primordial motivational states, which are mediated by the <a href="/item/bc549722-18db-451e-b33c-b5fe93e84846">hypothalamus</a> and other biologically pre-programmed systems 16:46.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The specific manner in which these systems are expressed and integrated depends on the particulars of the society and culture, which is why an 18-year framework is necessary to hone the expression of these systems 17:20.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best way to conceptualize personality development is as the hierarchical integration of motivational states within an overarching superordinate personality that takes the medium and long-term into account and is not self-serving 17:31.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cortex plays a crucial role in this process, integrating lower-order motivational states into a broader vision of the world that takes the future and other people into account 17:55.  </p>

<li>
<p>The <a href="/item/903675ee-1aa2-4852-9e39-845d0462982c">prefrontal cortex</a> is responsible for context-dependent strategy setting, and it has direct access to the <a href="/item/bc549722-18db-451e-b33c-b5fe93e84846">hypothalamus</a>, which controls basic drives such as rage, sexual appetite, thirst, and hunger 18:20.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is involved in context-dependent learning and decision-making, and it plays a crucial role in modifying impulses to take into account the context and the needs and desires of others 19:11.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of children, the prefrontal cortex helps them learn to integrate their own desires with the needs and desires of others, which is essential for <a href="/item/03f4eae7-ed6c-47d2-ad43-7f9c033038d0">socialization</a> and making friends 19:33.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the age of four, children need to have developed the ability to take turns and consider the needs of others, as this is essential for social integration and avoiding isolation 20:15.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of disciplining children is not about punishing them for being bad, but rather about teaching them to be more sophisticated and considerate of others, which is essential for their social development 20:30.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans are highly social creatures, and punishment by isolation can be effective even for antisocial individuals, highlighting the importance of social integration 20:52.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of parenting is to model a strategy for satisfying basic drives that takes into account the context and the needs of others, which helps to foster a meta-personality in the child 21:12.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This process of fostering a meta-personality is related to religious thinking, which often involves the attempt to formulate an ideal personality that is attributed to the <a href="/item/d23d3271-121c-4fcf-9902-9bf28156939d">divine</a> 21:35.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The brain's basic structure, even at the lower motivational level, is related to personality, and this changes the way we view the brain and its functions 21:54.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/item/b999a443-e3dd-401c-a5e8-fef89e652fbf">Archaic</a> deities can be seen as representing motivational systems, highlighting the complex relationship between the brain, personality, and religious thinking 22:02.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="/item/19d6073f-8c57-4be0-a6ce-50b54321432c">Vikings</a> invoked the <a href="/item/b47338c0-c635-4170-b5f8-a30589f556c7">God of War</a>, Mars, before going into battle, and they used <a href="/item/0fe695a4-0956-4d4c-8bc3-18e2e630cb12">Amanita muscaria</a>, a substance that affects the nicotinic and muscarinic receptor systems in the brain, to imitate predators and induce a state of rage 22:08.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amanita muscaria has two general receptor systems: the nicotinic system, which is a stimulant that also relaxes, and the muscarinic system, which creates changes in self-perception and perception of surroundings, making it similar to a psychedelic 22:21.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The muscarinic system has a unique effect of making people less fearful and more intrigued, and it is difficult to describe, as it is outside the typical psychedelic domain 22:37.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Vikings took Amanita muscaria as an agent to make the personality of rage superordinate, allowing them to practice and master the strategically aggressive impulse from a young age 23:02.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By taking Amanita muscaria, the Vikings were able to transform themselves into predators, narrowing the context within which their aggressive impulses could be channeled, and becoming experts at suppressing their own feelings of pain 23:21.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This transformation allowed the Vikings to bring the full resources of the cortex to the service of the rage circuits in the <a href="/item/bc549722-18db-451e-b33c-b5fe93e84846">hypothalamus</a>, creating a unique state that is difficult to imagine or understand 23:50.  </p>

<p>Research by <a href="/item/c0508013-ef94-4df9-93dc-0106e6582eae">David Anderson</a> at <a href="/item/35ce4fe6-0dec-4ff7-93ee-0202b2971163">Caltech</a> and his former postdoc Lynn discovered a small collection of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that, when stimulated, would send mice into a rage, but only in the presence of another mouse, indicating context-dependent behavior 24:22.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ventromedial hypothalamus contains mutually exclusive sets of neurons that, when stimulated, can either suppress rage and activate copulation or induce aggression, highlighting the complex interplay between these behaviors 25:01.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The juxtaposition of these neurons and behaviors is reminiscent of Freud's ideas on the juxtaposition of conflicting desires and impulses 25:17.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to broaden one's temporal scope and think about the time domain differently is crucial, as autonomic arousal and stress can cause individuals to lose sight of the past, present, and future 25:56.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="/item/bc549722-18db-451e-b33c-b5fe93e84846">hypothalamus</a> is a sophisticated structure that can run programs of personality, including perceptions, even in the absence of higher-order brain systems 27:18.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hypothalamus can control impulses and behaviors, and its various states can be conceptualized as subpersonalities, highlighting its complexity and importance 26:45.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research has shown that a <a href="/item/e7c9967a-c213-44c1-bd3b-941b0382c633">cat</a> with its entire brain removed except for the hypothalamus can still exhibit normal behavior, including exploratory behavior, in a controlled environment 26:52.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to expand one's apprehension of fundamental motivational systems is crucial for making decisions and guiding one's life path 27:36.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As people mature, they develop the capacity to regulate their behavior by taking more factors into account, which allows them to make decisions that balance their individual needs with the needs of others over longer periods of time 28:15.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This maturation process involves the development of the cortex, which enables individuals to forego immediate gratification and consider the consequences of their actions 28:19.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to balance individual needs with the needs of others is a key aspect of maturation, as it allows individuals to navigate the tension between their own desires and the demands of the group 28:49.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying one's individuality solely with the pursuit of immediate gratification, as hedonists and immature people do, is not a useful or sustainable approach to life 29:03.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This approach can lead to a form of psychopathy, where the individual prioritizes their own immediate needs above all else, without considering the consequences for themselves or others 29:35.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychopathy can be seen as an extension of immaturity into adulthood, where the individual fails to develop the capacity for self-regulation and consideration for others 29:41.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of maturation involves a form of internal conflict, where the individual must navigate the tension between their own desires and the demands of the group, and find a way to balance these competing forces 28:33.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This internal conflict is a necessary part of personal growth and development, as it allows individuals to develop the capacity for self-regulation and make decisions that take into account the needs of others 28:37.  </p>

<li>
<p>Psychopaths are notorious for their inability to learn from experience, meaning that they will continue to engage in impulsive behavior despite the trouble it causes them in the future, showing a lack of consideration for their own future selves and others 30:05.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This behavior is similar to that of toddlers, who are also non-communitarian and willing to betray their own future selves for immediate gratification 30:35.  </p>

<li>
<p>Research by <a href="/item/4ffa2f6c-f8d3-4f85-affc-90d52e48e880">Richard Tremblay</a> found that two-year-old boys are the most aggressive, with about 5% of them exhibiting antisocial behavior such as kicking, stealing, hitting, and biting 31:28.  </p>

<p>Most of these aggressive two-year-old boys are socialized by the age of four, but the ones who aren't tend to become alienated, juvenile delinquents, and eventually repeat offenders 31:45.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some children have a more dominant "rage circuit" than others, making them more prone to aggressive behavior, and this can be linked to a specific circuit in the <a href="/item/bc549722-18db-451e-b33c-b5fe93e84846">hypothalamus</a> that controls aggressive biting 32:03.  </p>

<li>
<p>This circuit is present in all humans, but most people learn to suppress it, except in situations where their life is endangered 32:36.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children who fail to suppress this circuit and continue to exhibit aggressive behavior, such as biting, into older childhood are a cause for concern and may indicate a lack of sophisticated <a href="/item/03f4eae7-ed6c-47d2-ad43-7f9c033038d0">socialization</a> 33:10.  </p>

<p>Much of what is seen as pathology, including narcissism and certain forms of hedonism, can be attributed to a failure of socialization 34:02.  </p>

<p><a href="/item/a73b19fb-ae0b-4b23-9153-1351bdd2b188">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> said that every drive attempts to philosophize, which is a brilliant observation that highlights the complex nature of human motivation 34:31.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hypothalamic drives can influence perception, as seen in the example of a mouse whose attack system is activated electronically, and can lead to the classification of certain stimuli as threats or enemies 34:52.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The activation of certain neurons can lead to a set of perceptual stimuli being classified as defeatable enemies, which can drive behavior and is more like a strategy than an impulse 35:13.  </p>

<p>The concept of motivational states as personalities can help understand the evolution of religious thinking, as seen in the work of historian of religions <a href="/item/d6c33d97-6daa-4c1e-8862-12b8a2220de4">Mircea Eliade</a> 35:43.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliade documented the pattern by which polytheistic belief systems turned into monotheistic belief systems, which parallels maturation and the development of more complex motivational states 36:13.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polytheistic gods can be seen as representations of different motivational states, such as the <a href="/item/b47338c0-c635-4170-b5f8-a30589f556c7">god of war</a> or the <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">god</a> of love, which are reflective of different hypothalamic and related circuits 36:29.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These motivational states can have a history and philosophy, and can possess individuals if they are not aware of their influence 37:22.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of possession can be seen in the example of becoming enraged during a fight, where the motivational impulse can take over and influence behavior 37:31.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When individuals are consumed by strong emotions like rage or resentment, they can become possessed by a "spirit" that takes control of their actions, often accompanied by sophisticated intellectual rationalizations 37:53.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This state of possession can be seen in people who are psychotic, and it can also be observed in individuals who engage in violent behavior, such as school shooters, who may fantasize about violence for thousands of hours under the influence of rage and resentment 38:22.  </p>

<p>Research by <a href="/item/7b1df838-482a-42f3-96ea-8cd3f49dda71">David Spiegel</a>, Vice Chair of Psychiatry at <a href="/item/ad24d728-9610-4f0b-ace7-2bd617c6416e">Stanford</a>, has shown that in certain conditions, including depression, the direction of flow between the <a href="/item/903675ee-1aa2-4852-9e39-845d0462982c">prefrontal cortex</a> and the insula can reverse, leading to a reversal of the typical neurological order 38:56.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When individuals drop into primitive states and emotions for an extended period, the prefrontal cortex, which normally acts as the "governor," can start to become governed by the more primitive states, leading to a reversal of the typical top-down control 39:35.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This reversal can also be seen in addiction, where repeated doses of dopamine can create a "monster" in the brain that grows and becomes more dominant, eventually taking control of the individual's behavior 39:52.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "monster" in addiction can be thought of as a subpersonality that has its own personality, can lie, and is reinforced by dopaminergic hits, leading to pathological behavior 40:33.  </p>

<li>
<p>This concept is related to the idea of polytheistic paganism, where multiple "gods" or subpersonalities exist within an individual, and the default condition is one of multiple, conflicting personalities 40:57.  </p>

<p>A friend struggled with multiple addictions, including alcohol and drugs, and attended multiple rehab centers, but was unable to stay sober until he attended a center that treated addiction with a belief in <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">God</a>, and has since been sober for over four years 43:59.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The friend's transformation is attributed to a change in his brain's incentive structure, which was not achieved through fear of consequences, but rather through adopting a different belief system 45:46.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of prayer can be thought of as inviting a positive spirit or mindset to possess oneself, and establishing a relationship with an ideal mode of conduct and perception 46:15.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the context of addiction, generating a hypothesis about an ideal mode of conduct and perception, and establishing a relationship with it, can be a powerful tool for recovery 46:45.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research has shown that religious transformation is the most reliable treatment for alcoholism, and this is attributed to incentive restructuring, which can help individuals overcome the rewarding effects of addictive substances 47:21.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rewarding effects of addictive substances, such as alcohol and cocaine, can be so powerful that they can override fear and other negative consequences, making it difficult for individuals to overcome addiction through fear alone 47:42.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The environment in which an individual is in can also play a role in their susceptibility to addiction, with isolation and lack of natural stimuli increasing the likelihood of addiction 47:53.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treating addiction involves substituting a new incentive structure, as the addictive process often involves falling into a false incentive pattern where the addictive substance mimics a sense of achieving an important goal, even if it's not actually being achieved 48:03.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cocaine is a remarkable drug that can induce a high dopaminergic state, making users excited about everything and exceptionally good at finding the substance, even in the absence of resources 48:39.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who take hard drugs that spike dopamine can manage to obtain the substance through various means, including lying, cheating, and stealing, or socializing with people who have it 49:01.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pathway to achieving a goal or overcoming addiction appears when the aim is firmly in mind, and this is derived from religious literature, which suggests that if the aim is upward, the pathway forward will make itself manifest 49:20.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The addicted brain is possessed by the substance of addiction, which dominates the perceptual and emotional landscapes, making all pathways and objects markers on the way to obtaining the substance, and comes with rationalizations and lies 50:03.  </p>

<p>The discussion around pornography is often linked to the discussion around masturbation, and it's essential to acknowledge that sexual behavior is connected to reproduction, a necessary precondition for human existence 50:46.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some individuals, typically young males, struggle with the desire to view pornography, which can become a compulsion that feels almost unconscious, leading them to question whether they're broken or if it's the prevalence of pornography that's the issue 51:35.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's possible that individuals who struggle with pornography are not broken, but rather, they're experiencing the manifestation of one part of their personality that has been compulsively rewarded 52:24.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When individuals engage in behavior that leads to a desired goal, such as viewing pornography, dopamine is released, which increases the probability that the circuits activated before the positive experience will grow, potentially leading to addiction 52:43.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of super stimuli, observed in simpler animals like stickleback fish, can help explain why individuals may find certain stimuli, such as pornography, virtually irresistible 53:34.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Super stimuli can produce maximal activation in individuals, even if the stimulus is not something they would typically encounter in nature, which can contribute to compulsive behavior 54:12.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The widespread availability of pornography can be considered a super stimulus, particularly for young males, as it caters to the visually-oriented nature of male sexuality in humans 54:18.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This super stimulus can be accessed easily and with minimal effort, making it a significant evolutionary and ecological transformation 55:01.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A similar concept can be applied to the food world, where highly palatable and <a href="/item/196892dd-df77-4b9d-878a-eb10c28d6386">processed foods</a>, such as those combining sugar and fat, can be considered a super stimulus 55:10.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many modern convenience foods and drinks combine multiple stimulants, including sugar, caffeine, and other substances, which can be problematic when consumed excessively 55:34.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of manufacturing sugar can be compared to the production of cocaine, as both involve purifying a naturally occurring substance to create a more potent and potentially addictive product 55:58.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purification of sugar and other substances can make them more problematic for human consumption, as seen in the difference between the traditional use of cocoa leaves as a mild stimulant and the addictive nature of cocaine 56:08.  </p>

<li>
<p>Following a <a href="/item/3b6f93ee-070d-43f7-ba92-ad4bfe11abf7">clean diet</a>, such as an elimination diet, helps learn the relationship between the taste of food, its volume, macronutrient content, micronutrients, and satiation 56:21.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The brain and <a href="/item/bc549722-18db-451e-b33c-b5fe93e84846">hypothalamus</a> learn the association between the taste, caloric content, and other components of food and satiation, but this is difficult to do with highly <a href="/item/196892dd-df77-4b9d-878a-eb10c28d6386">processed foods</a> 57:09.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processed foods activate multiple neuron systems in the hypothalamus and gut, making it hard for the brain to parse the various components and their relation to feelings of satisfaction 57:19.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gut has neurons that respond to sugar, fatty acids, and amino acid content, and signals through the vagus nerve to the dopaminergic centers of the brain, which can stimulate eating 57:48.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gut's neurons can signal the brain to eat more of a food that has a high essential amino acid content, such as a steak, but may not respond as strongly to foods with low essential amino acid content, like candy 58:16.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two parallel tracks to satiation: one dependent on taste and one dependent on actual nutrient content, and the mouth can only learn taste associations, while the gut knows nutrient content 58:50.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foods low in micronutrients or macronutrients can keep the appetite system revving until enough of those nutrients are consumed, leading to the concept of "empty calories" 59:06.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This concept is analogous to the discussion around pornography, masturbation, and reproduction, where the body's natural response to certain stimuli can be disrupted by artificial or processed stimuli 59:32.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, it is a reality that humans will continue eating if they do not have a gut-level understanding of what they are consuming, as the body's impulse to eat is triggered by blood glucose elevations linked to the dopaminergic system 59:41.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highly <a href="/item/196892dd-df77-4b9d-878a-eb10c28d6386">processed foods</a> can hijack the body's circuits, spiking dopamine dramatically and leading to overconsumption, similar to the effects of drugs like methamphetamine or behaviors like watching pornography 01:00:43.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To teach the body's circuits a calmer and more prudent version of themselves, it is necessary to break down foods into their essential elements and understand the motivations and pleasures associated with eating 01:00:58.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of novelty plays a role in the dopaminergic kick associated with repetitive pleasures, and an optimized threshold for novelty and repetitive striving can lead to a pattern of increasing extremity or fetishism, as seen in pornographic usage 01:01:35.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A similar pattern can be observed in eating habits, where the use of condiments or sauces can lead to a decrease in the perceived taste of plain foods, but returning to a more natural mode of eating can make these foods taste good again and even make condiments seem aversive 01:02:14.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of <a href="/item/b3b47a14-62f6-4f69-bbfe-faa05b437d30">Umami</a> taste is mentioned, which is a complex taste that humans have a devoted receptor for, and the example of a <a href="/item/42fa6a10-2d83-46a5-9b63-201b4a464638">Pittsburgh</a> Char steak is given as a way to experience this taste 01:02:30.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Returning to a more natural mode of engaging with the body's circuits, such as eating plain foods or having sex without the influence of pornography, can lead to a more naturally satisfying experience 01:03:01.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who are addicted to pornography often report that it is no longer satisfying and they feel trapped, with a diminished amount of dopamine over time, and they have not been socialized to pursue real relationships due to their addiction 01:03:14.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research suggests that being socialized into pornography-based sexuality can make it difficult to establish a sexual relationship with an actual partner, as it sets up unrealistic expectations and alters biological systems in the brain to evoke arousal through observation rather than participation 01:03:41.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This can lead to individuals learning to be voyeurs, which is a completely different experience from participating in sex, and this can have unknown effects on the development of young brains, particularly for young men who are going through puberty and experiencing intense sexual urges 01:04:21.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The introduction of pornography can make it challenging for individuals to navigate complex sexual behaviors and relationships in the real world, as it creates a landscape of expectation that may not be met in reality 01:03:56.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effects of pornography on the development of young people, especially young men, are not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to determine the long-term consequences of exposure to pornography during puberty 01:04:38.  </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The ultimate form of "action at a distance" is creating a new human being with someone, as it propagates life in both physical distance and time 01:09:05.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast, activities like masturbation and pornography have no "action at a distance" and can be seen as a loop of energy back into oneself, with no impact on others 01:09:26.  </p>

<p>This loop of energy can be detrimental, as it can lead to a lack of creation, knowledge, technology, children, communities, and culture, which are essential for human evolution and progress 01:09:42.  </p>

<p>The concept of "action at a distance" is also relevant to the idea of personal growth and ambition, where individuals strive to achieve their goals and make a positive impact on the world 01:11:35.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The story of <a href="/item/fddb87de-6bc7-4a34-bc9d-171ee54b3195">Abraham</a> is an example of how ambition and the pursuit of a higher goal can be a driving force for personal growth and transformation 01:11:03.  </p>

<p>The concept of the <a href="/item/d23d3271-121c-4fcf-9902-9bf28156939d">Divine</a> can be seen as the ultimate target or meta-ambition that guides human aspirations and ambitions, and is something that recedes as one approaches it 01:12:01.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure to find a productive way to have "action at a distance" can lead to problems such as the "<a href="/item/7fed02f4-1d2a-4492-93df-a01d45fcc6af">Failure to Launch</a>" phenomenon, where individuals fail to disperse from their families and create their own lives 01:10:42.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of "action at a distance" is also relevant to the concept of personal responsibility and the need for individuals to take action and make a positive impact on the world 01:10:51.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of ambition implies a commonality among ambitions, and in the story of Abraham, the Divine is characterized in relation to ambition, where Abraham is immersed in a situation of abundance, having wealthy parents who provide for him, and has no reason to move forward until he's 75 and the voice of Adventure, or <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">God</a>, compels him to leave his comfort zone 01:12:16.  </p>

<li>
<p>The voice of Adventure, or God, tells Abraham to leave his father's tent, tribe, and those who speak his language, and venture out into the world, implying that having everything one needs is not how life works, and that one must take risks and face challenges to truly live 01:13:34.  </p>

<p>This instinct is characterized as the voice of Adventure, which asks individuals to move beyond their comfort zone and into the foreign world, where they can fortify themselves and develop, leading to a higher form of attainment than mere attainment of specific goals 01:15:53.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of transformation requires sacrifice, and participating in this process is a higher form of attainment than mere attainment of any specific goal, as it allows individuals to develop and become better than they currently are 01:16:25.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of the "Call to Adventure" is a quest that pushes individuals beyond their comfort zone, as seen in the example of <a href="/item/1c4c459c-168d-487f-994f-e8289011be9c">Gandalf</a> offering <a href="/item/8a20bd91-4e64-40ef-b12d-2000ab3a8849">Bilbo</a> a quest, and is characterized by voluntary action and a sense of adventure 01:16:33.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If individuals push themselves beyond their comfort zone, they will live a life that is a blessing to themselves, which is the opposite of the lives of miserable, depressed, and trapped people 01:16:57.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pathway to a blessed life is not one of satiation, but rather a voluntary quest that is characterized by adventure 01:17:19.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By embarking on this quest, individuals will not only live a life that is a blessing to themselves, but also become renowned among others, which is a desirable outcome due to the importance of social status 01:17:37.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, individuals will establish something of lasting value that will maximize the probability of their success across multiple generations 01:18:10.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This concept is illustrated in the story of <a href="/item/fddb87de-6bc7-4a34-bc9d-171ee54b3195">Abraham</a>, who is told by <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">God</a> that if he follows the path of adventure, he will be the father of nations and establish a pattern of paternal conduct that will maximize the success of his offspring 01:18:23.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ultimately, individuals who embark on this quest will bring abundance to everyone else, which is a biologically desirable outcome 01:18:47.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The instinct to embark on this quest is aligned with psychological and social well-being, and is therefore likely to be a fundamental drive that facilitates transformation across time 01:19:38.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, it is possible to get lost in false adventures, such as addiction or pornography, which are failures to hit the proper target 01:20:00.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The central drive to integration across time and communally is likely to be an instinct that guides individuals towards a life of adventure and blessing 01:20:11.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of the Spirit of Adventure is often characterized in a paternal manner, as seen in ancient stories where God is depicted as the father. 01:20:27  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A good father encourages their child, particularly their son, to push beyond their limits in an adventurous manner, embodying the spirit that calls to adventure. 01:20:51  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This encouragement is a key aspect of being a good father, as it allows the child to grow and develop, and is exemplified in the story of <a href="/item/fddb87de-6bc7-4a34-bc9d-171ee54b3195">Abraham</a>, who forged an alliance with the spirit of his ancestors and the deity of his ancestors. 01:21:07  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abraham's embodiment of the Call to Adventure is what makes him a successful father, with his reproductive enterprise being successful across a broad span of time. 01:21:20  </p>

<li>
<p>The biblical story of Noah presents <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">God</a> as a personality that is characterized differently, with Noah being a wise and moral man who is chosen to receive a warning from God about an impending disaster 01:21:30.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The voice that calls to Noah is seen as a manifestation of the <a href="/item/d23d3271-121c-4fcf-9902-9bf28156939d">Divine</a>, which is also the same voice that calls the unwilling to adventure, representing the monotheistic hypothesis 01:22:22.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The imagination is trying to agglomerate different characterizations of high aim, insisting that there's an integrated unity behind them, and this is done with radical success in the biblical library 01:22:35.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The culmination of the library of stories is an impressionistic representation of this integrating pattern, which people call upon when engaging in a religious enterprise 01:22:57.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person's incentive structure and motivation can be transformed through a religious experience, as seen in the case of a friend who overcame addiction and developed a new personality with a different incentive structure 01:23:11.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The friend attributes his transformation to feeling Jesus's love for him and seeing an image of who he could become, which gave him a new sense of purpose and direction 01:24:00.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transformation was not just limited to his time in a residential facility, but he was able to carry it with him and maintain it outside of that context 01:24:32.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mystery of the friend's transformation lies in the relationship between his realization of Jesus's love for him, his vision of who he could be, and his newfound freedom from addiction 01:24:57.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that a given stimulus produces a given motivational response is incorrect, as the framework and context in which the stimulus is perceived can change the motivational drive 01:25:48.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A motivational drive can change the target and rearrange the perceptual landscape, transforming emotions and making certain action patterns more likely to manifest 01:26:02.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The friend's transformation resulted in a radical change in his incentive structure and orientation, with a new aim and target that gave rise to different emotions and motivations 01:26:41.  </p>

<li>
<p>Dopamine is a currency of motivation and reward, and it has no intelligence, but rather serves as a motivator that can be gained through various means, including substances like cocaine, as it interacts with the hypothalamic system 01:27:00.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As one moves towards a target, dopamine increases, and the probability of one's perception deviating from the target decreases exponentially, leading to increased focus and motivation 01:27:27.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of sin can be understood as missing the target, with the <a href="/item/d04640ce-2a77-4a47-ba0c-19a4a5a9feb4">Greek</a> word "hamartia" and ancient <a href="/item/3e391db9-ee3b-4838-b13e-1a85c30f3112">Hebrew</a> terms for sin being derived from archery, highlighting the importance of target-seeking physiopsychology 01:28:15.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans have a unique ability to infer aim from gaze, and even mimic the psychophysiological state of the target being watched, allowing for a deep understanding of others' goals and motivations 01:28:48.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frontal eye fields, a region in the frontal cortex, play a crucial role in generating reflexive eye movements and are responsible for the top-down inhibition of reflexes, distinguishing humans from other animals 01:29:21.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research has shown that in the absence of a <a href="/item/903675ee-1aa2-4852-9e39-845d0462982c">prefrontal cortex</a> or its suppression, animals and humans can become like machines, responding solely to stimuli without top-down inhibition 01:30:05.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The brain has an area that is highly exploratory, similar to a <a href="/item/e7c9967a-c213-44c1-bd3b-941b0382c633">cat</a> with no brain, where everything is a target and there is no context-dependent learning 01:30:21.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cats, even those without a cortex, can perform fictive motion, such as walking on a treadmill, which is an impressive ability 01:30:32.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans have frontal eye fields, a cortical area that is expanded compared to other species, which is dedicated to controlling gaze and its context 01:30:42.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frontal eye fields regulate context-dependent learning, allowing humans to infer meaning from gaze, such as determining if someone's direct gaze is aggressive or not 01:31:04.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans can infer meaning from gaze through various cues, including body language and facial responses, and have a highly developed understanding of gaze compared to other animals 01:31:22.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to control and understand gaze is crucial in human interaction, as it allows individuals to define and understand what others consider to be the target or focus of attention 01:31:50.  </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As people mature and their cortex integrates, they become cortically dominant, allowing them to concentrate on long-term goals at the expense of short-term distractions 01:32:08.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The brain's automatic response to sudden noises, such as an anti-predator crouch, is an example of the control of eye gaze and bodily posture by underlying motivational systems 01:32:34.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, people can also voluntarily orient their eyes and attention towards a desired goal or target, such as a "north star" that guides their navigation 01:33:19.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This concept of a "meta-target" can help individuals progress towards their goals in a way that makes all potential targets more likely to be achieved 01:33:38.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A personal anecdote is shared about a friend who overcame addiction and became more effective in all areas of his life, as if every goal was "elevated" 01:33:41.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This friend's transformation was remarkable, and he remained consistent with his program over four years, becoming more grounded and present in his interactions 01:34:15.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The story of this friend's transformation is likened to an archetypal story, and is used to illustrate the concept of a "metag goal strategy" 01:35:18.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/item/01f4429a-bfe0-4d62-b3e4-744e60c9cc75">The Sermon on the Mount</a> is mentioned as an example of a practical and metag goal strategy that can help individuals navigate their lives 01:35:29.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life can be viewed as a sequence of episodes, each with a beginning, middle, and end, and the beginning sets the frame for the episode, so it's essential to establish the highest possible goal at the start to constitute the frame of perception for that episode 01:36:06.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To guide life decisions and path, one should first orient their eyes upward, establishing an allegiance with a higher power or utmost aim, and allowing that to determine their perceptions and motivations 01:35:54.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This approach is in alignment with the biblical tradition and The Sermon on the Mount, where Christ advises his followers to love <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">God</a> above all and to treat others as if they participate in that nature of utmost aim 01:35:50.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concentrating on the moment is also crucial, as specifying one's aim makes the pathway manifest, and attending to it allows for optimal use of what's present 01:37:55.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This approach implies that there's no difference between focusing on the longest temporal scale and highest possible elevation and participating in life eternal as it unfolds in the moment 01:38:39.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conceptualizing goals in relationship to one another across the broadest span of time and person is a deeper problem, and solving it would be like pursuing a metagoal, which defines the religious Enterprise 01:39:12.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A variant of this approach is solving the problem of the class of things that terrify you, rather than just a specific problem, which is represented by the concept of the dragon 01:39:41.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopting a voluntary approach in the face of terror is considered the best meta strategy to protect oneself across a wide range of dangerous situations 01:39:51.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This approach involves voluntarily confronting what one is afraid of, which increases competence and bravery, rather than reducing fear 01:40:16.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The particulars of what someone is afraid of are somewhat irrelevant, as the goal is to develop a generalizable sense of bravery and competence 01:40:12.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposure therapy, used in clinical psychology, teaches people to confront their fears voluntarily, leading to increased bravery and competence 01:40:09.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pursuit of metagoals in relation to positive and negative emotions is a key aspect of the religious pursuit, which can be a guiding framework for life decisions 01:40:30.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing a voluntary stance in the face of fear and uncertainty can be an effective way to guide life decisions and navigate challenging situations 01:39:47.  </p>

<p>When dealing with conflicts, such as an argument with a spouse, it's essential to look beyond the immediate outcome and consider the long-term effects on the relationship, striving for an "ultimate victory" that benefits both parties and promotes growth over time 01:41:54.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the heat of the moment, it's easy to get hijacked by emotions and aim for a "proximal victory," but this approach can ultimately lead to a worse outcome, whereas taking a step back and considering the bigger picture can lead to a more desirable result 01:42:29.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To achieve this, one must be willing to substitute their desire to win with a desire for a deeper and more enriching outcome, which requires a genuine willingness to listen and find a pathway that benefits the relationship 01:43:22.  </p>

<p>This approach is reminiscent of Christ's Parable of the <a href="/item/28c0bfc8-b2df-4d09-a68d-ab5b5beae901">pearl of great price</a>, where a rich man would sell everything to possess something of immense value, highlighting the importance of prioritizing long-term goals over short-term gains 01:43:56.  </p>

<p>It's also crucial to recognize that instant gratification, such as that provided by drugs, pornography, or highly <a href="/item/196892dd-df77-4b9d-878a-eb10c28d6386">processed foods</a>, can be detrimental to one's well-being and run counter to evolutionary wiring, emphasizing the importance of effort and hard work in achieving meaningful rewards 01:44:40.  </p>

<li>
<p>In contrast, social media platforms like X, <a href="/item/6b4482f0-1c1c-4556-a5c8-f6b67d76eaec">Instagram</a>, etc., train users for fast temporal time scales, which can be detrimental if not used appropriately 01:46:15.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notion of overnight success or "Rags to Riches" exists in the culture, which can affect people's perception of time scales and rewards 01:46:50.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's essential to take a look at one's life and ask over what variation of time scales they derive reward, as training for a marathon or getting a school degree requires a longer time scale, which is a hallmark of maturity 01:47:09.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A better question to ask is how to optimize one's long-term view while maximizing focus on the moment, which can lead to a good balance between short-term and long-term goals 01:47:31.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conducting oneself in a manner that works in an iterated way, socially productive, and intergenerationally socially productive is crucial for establishing a good balance between short-term and long-term goals 01:47:46.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anxiety signifies the emergence of entropy, which gives emotion a physical grounding, and Carl Friston has a theory of positive emotion that's analogous to this concept 01:48:17.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing uncertainty in relation to a goal can give a person a dopamine kick, as it decreases entropy, and this concept is related to the phenomenon of seeing the finish line and starting to run faster 01:48:49.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having goals at multiple time scales requires being able to withstand periods of uncertainty, which is part of becoming an adult 01:49:27.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The more valuable the goal, the higher the dopamine kick per unit of advancement, making it desirable to have an ultimate goal operating in the domain of each proximal sub-goal 01:49:42.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ultimate goal can be to make things as good as they could be over the longest possible span of time for the largest number of people, even if the exact steps to achieve it are unknown 01:50:02.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having such a goal can inform perceptions and modify the reward system, making every proximal step forward an indicator of entropy reduction in regard to the meta-goal 01:50:18.  </p>

<li>
<p>Pursuing a worthwhile goal can lead to a rewriting of the reward contingencies, making temptations like addiction less appealing 01:50:39.  </p>

<p>Pornography is considered poisonous due to its ability to provide a level of certainty and instant gratification, which is not reflective of real-life relationships where uncertainty and rejection are inherent 01:51:23.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The constant rejection in real-life relationships serves as a corrective, allowing individuals to learn and improve, whereas pornography provides an escape from this process, hindering personal growth and the possibility of forming meaningful connections 01:52:09.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implications of a pornography and masturbation scenario are limited to seeking more extreme content, as the brain requires novelty to maintain dopamine levels, leading to a degenerating cycle 01:52:40.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This cycle can result in the escalation of extreme content, ultimately undermining psychological integrity and contributing to the collapse of individuals' lives, even those who appear successful 01:53:25.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The collapse of individuals' lives can also be seen in cases of drug abuse, particularly with dopaminergic substances, which can have a similar effect on the brain as pornography 01:53:42.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of time and its limitations is crucial, as it can lead to the end of various aspects of life, including relationships and personal growth, and is reflected in the vision of the end of time in <a href="/item/cbe8517b-ad3d-47f6-a756-92d8d4ecf150">Revelation</a> 01:54:05.  </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The Scarlet Beast is symbolic of the state, which has multiple heads, representing the fragmentation and disintegration of society, and is associated with the death of <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">God</a> or the loss of a unifying force 01:55:11.  </p>

<p>The figure of the "<a href="/item/d6345ceb-f893-4a70-ab13-c8f65d949328">whore of Babylon</a>" represents the commoditization of female sexuality, where a woman subordinates her psyche to the demands of her sexuality, leading to a state of extreme attractiveness and a focus on the consequences of her fornication 01:55:59.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recent example of this phenomenon is a woman who had sex with 100 men in a day and planned to do the same with 1,000 men, illustrating the dark consequences of such actions and the rethinking of her plan due to the emotional aftermath 01:56:26.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This situation is seen as a sign of the degeneration of the masculine state, where female sexuality becomes commoditized due to the unreliability of the masculine, leading to a destructive cycle 01:58:50.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The degenerate state offers the "whore of Babylon" as an enticement for its degeneration, promising unlimited sexual satisfaction, but ultimately leading to the destruction of sexuality itself as a long-term consequence 01:59:10.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The story of the "whore of Babylon" serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating the dangers of sacrificing long-term consequences for short-term sexual gratification, and the ultimate destruction of one's own desires 01:59:29.  </p>

<li>
<p>A recent online post caught attention with a debate about restoring vigor, pride, and achievement, which are considered a beautiful trifecta to celebrate. 02:02:47  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of vigor, pride, and achievement is linked to the idea of generative action at a distance, technological development, and the story of <a href="/item/fddb87de-6bc7-4a34-bc9d-171ee54b3195">Abraham</a>, which represents the highest form of potential satiation through risky romantic adventure. 02:03:10  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risky romantic adventure is considered the highest form of reward, and conservatives need to learn that responsibility and adventure are the same thing, not just dutiful orderly productivity. 02:04:32  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young men, in particular, are built for adventure, and it can increase their status, improve their life, and improve the probability of accomplishing something they want. 02:05:09  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adventure can be found in the voluntary adoption of responsibility, which is an important concept that has not been taught to young people for generations. 02:05:25  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting one's room in order is a great morning ritual that can help with thinking clearly, especially for those with a depressive tilt, and can be a first-order business to start the day. 02:05:40  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking a short time each day to order one thing, such as part of a tool box, can help things fall into place over time. 02:06:18  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark Andre's statement about restoring vigor, pride, and achievement is a beautiful trifecta that resonates with the idea of celebrating these values. 02:02:57  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting the day with linear operations, such as making one's bed and organizing space, can be an antidote to chaos and provide a sense of relief and structure in a world with numerous options and distractions 02:06:27.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a clear target or goal can help guide one's actions and decisions, and it is not sinful to set and work towards such targets 02:06:50.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that adventure and responsibility are the same thing can be seen in action movies, such as James Bond films, where the protagonist takes risks and faces challenges to achieve a higher goal 02:07:10.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In such stories, the stakes are high, and the outcome matters, which is what makes them gripping and meaningful 02:07:51.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of sacrifice is central to many communities, as seen in the architecture of the <a href="/item/a1074e3d-43c2-4976-ab24-4803644e3141">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</a> in <a href="/item/08a45afd-7b84-48f0-8438-e0d5cae88bdc">Jerusalem</a>, where the image of the crucifixion is at the center of the altar 02:08:23.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This pattern of a sacrificial image at the center of a community is repeated in many European towns, and it represents the idea that responsible sacrifice is at the core of community 02:08:52.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community itself can be seen as a sacrificial gesture, where individuals offer up their own desires and interests for the benefit of the group 02:09:13.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This idea of sacrifice as the center of community has been acted out in Christian-oriented civilization for the past 2,000 years, and it is what integrates individuals and societies psychologically and makes them productive 02:09:32.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The center of a city, which is often considered a symbol of the state of society, has deteriorated and become a place to avoid, raising questions about the relationship between the state of society and the condition of city centers 02:10:16.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The deterioration of city centers is not unrelated to the state of society, as the center not holding is a sign of chaos and disorder, a realization that has been understood by humans for a long time 02:11:02.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The famous poem by TS Elliott, which mentions the center loosening and mere chaos being set upon the world, highlights the importance of a strong center in maintaining order and stability 02:11:07.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The degeneration of the center can be attributed to various factors, with the culture war being a meditation on this question, and the postmodernist idea that we see the world through a story being a significant contributor to this degeneration 02:11:30.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The postmodernist idea that our knowledge is built through stories rather than an aggregation of facts is a devastating blow to empiricists and rationalists, and highlights the importance of understanding the role of stories in shaping our perceptions 02:11:51.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="storytelling-science-career-advancement-pursuing-truth-021202">Storytelling, Science, Career Advancement, Pursuing Truth 02:12:02<a class="headerlink" href="#storytelling-science-career-advancement-pursuing-truth-021202" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The prioritization of the world of facts is often categorized into three groups: religion, which teaches through story; philosophy, which teaches through language divorced from story; and science, which aims to remove language almost entirely and present objective facts through graphs and figures 02:12:03.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, storytelling is an inherent part of the human brain, working in a narrative structure of beginning, middle, and end, and it inevitably creeps into science, making it impossible to be completely value-free 02:12:40.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An example of the dangers of value-free science is the story of a lab in the <a href="/item/2496cf93-7baf-4151-8e79-a15dafedb4a2">Soviet Union</a> where scientists attempted to create an amalgam of <a href="/item/6822b6de-d55d-4fb9-8f9e-b3f5d0cc2f45">Ebola</a> and smallpox, resulting in the death of around 500 people, highlighting the potential for science to be used for evil purposes 02:12:55.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of the "evil scientist" is a common trope in movies, illustrating the understanding that science can be used for malevolent purposes, and it is essential to acknowledge this and encapsulate science within a value structure 02:13:39.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scientific community has become less reliable over the past 20 years, partly due to the destabilization of the underlying story and values, leading to the rise of narcissistic and immature psychopaths who do not make good scientists 02:15:45.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assault on science and logic at universities has intensified, despite the expectation that the humanistic and atheistic impulses would lead to a more rational and scientific approach, as seen in the ideas of <a href="/item/a52e65aa-3d94-40c6-96f0-404a3df586a6">Richard Dawkins</a> 02:15:03.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of a value structure in science is highlighted by the atrocities committed by scientists in <a href="/item/09a8ca5c-6f4c-4e89-9394-2b953aad9309">Unit 731</a> during the <a href="/item/7cefa34d-53cd-4a80-ba38-fc874d346820">Japanese</a> invasion of <a href="/item/83760502-3047-4503-9467-037d641a4266">China</a>, demonstrating the need for science to be guided by a moral framework 02:14:30.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science is built on lineages, where the primary value used to be seeking out new territory, but now 95% of scientists in a given subfield work on similar problems, validate each other, and fund each other, resulting in untouched problems and a lack of innovation 02:16:02.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This has led to a debacle in the field of Alzheimer's and dementia, where one laboratory fudged data, and everyone agreed to work on it despite knowing the data was falsified, illustrating the problem of "bad family values" being passed on through generations 02:16:50.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The careerist aspect of science has taken over, where scientists prioritize demonstrating they're right over discovering they're wrong, which is hard on their career in the short term, leading to a subversion of the scientific enterprise 02:17:24.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science is a difficult endeavor that requires putting discovering one's mistakes before demonstrating one's successes, and it's not surprising that people would prioritize career enhancement over the truth 02:17:33.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The period from 1550 to 1980 was an exception where science worked, but it's unclear what conditions were in place for people to prioritize the truth, and it's not surprising that science has degenerated into dynasty and nepotism 02:18:13.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prioritize the truth, one needs to reward true adventure and novelty, taking on novel problems, and funding should be allocated to support new and innovative research rather than incremental science 02:18:52.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The biggest challenge in science funding is rewarding science that's already completed and fits with the current narrative, rather than taking great risks and prioritizing the truth above all else 02:19:13.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage innovation and risk-taking in science, it's essential to reward failure when it involves genuine effort to solve problems, and provide young scientists with funding and the opportunity to tackle novel problems, understanding that most will fail, but not necessarily being exited from the university, instead giving them a new problem to tackle 02:19:40.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science must be embedded in a story to provide motivation, as motivation is the handmaiden of some story, and the motivational framework for scientific inquiry is very stringent, with truth above all 02:20:19.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pursuit of truth is a difficult thing to establish, but it's essential to hold truth in relation to human flourishing higher than one's own self-valuation, and this can be instilled in young scientists as a medium to long-term game 02:20:59.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuing the truth is worth the risk, as it can lead to spectacular success, and falsifying data can lead to pursuing something that doesn't exist and warping the whole field 02:21:22.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instilling love of the truth in students requires believing that the truth will set them free, which is a religious presumption, and serving truth is the best long-term strategy and the best adventure 02:21:59.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truth is an adventure because following the path of truth requires letting go of the predictability of the outcome, and accepting the outcome as the best possible outcome, even if it's not understood 02:22:36.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embracing the unknown and letting go of predetermined goals is the essence of adventure, and it's exciting because it's like bounding over the uncharted sea, not knowing what's going to happen next 02:23:22.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exchanging true value for predictability and security in one's career is a common choice, but it may be settling for something second-rate 02:23:31.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This decision is comparable to the biblical story of <a href="/item/fddb87de-6bc7-4a34-bc9d-171ee54b3195">Abraham</a>, who chose a path of adventure and uncertainty over a more secure option 02:23:42.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having an adventure and taking risks can be more valuable than opting for a predictable and secure career path 02:23:45.  </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Abraham's story is an example of someone who left behind an indulgent life to pursue something truly generative and in service to something larger, which is a common human desire for adventure and purposeful satisfaction 02:23:47.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that people want all the adventures of life to be thrown at them is reflected in stories like <a href="/item/432dc6a3-cdc0-4ef5-be6c-adf0685084eb">The Lord of the Rings</a> and <a href="/item/f49dde74-1d02-425d-8403-c4e9fca7b8a0">The Hobbit</a>, which dramatize human personality and the search for identity and redemption 02:24:19.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The genuine identity of an individual is tied to their ability to aim up and live in the spirit of truth, which can lead to a redemptive adventure that justifies the suffering inherent in life 02:24:41.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone's life is full of possibilities for suffering, but having something exciting and generative to do can provide a sense of purpose and direction 02:25:26.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting one's sights on the proximal and focusing on the present moment can be a driving force behind personal and professional endeavors 02:25:52.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The act of generating and disseminating useful information can be a highly intrinsically motivating activity that brings deep satisfaction 02:26:27.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This intrinsic pleasure can be seen as a manifestation of the instinct that integrates individuals across time and with other people, leading to a sense of concordance between personal and societal interests 02:26:55.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans have an instinct to mark the pathway that integrates them psychologically and socially, leading to a sense of deepest satisfaction when pursuing this course of action 02:27:42.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that people would find deep satisfaction in rejecting knowledge and hoarding it for themselves is absurd and laughable 02:27:59.  </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Organizing one's physical space is the starting point for moving from chaos to order, and this process can be extended to other areas of life to help individuals find their calling and navigate their path 02:28:14.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsibility and adventure can serve as a compass to guide individuals in finding their calling and having a positive impact on the world 02:28:44.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concepts of calling and conscience are two of the highest-order characterizations of the <a href="/item/d23d3271-121c-4fcf-9902-9bf28156939d">Divine</a> in the biblical library, and they can be thought of as integrated manifestations of positive and negative emotions 02:29:10.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calling can be understood as the voice of integrated positive emotion, which fills individuals with enthusiasm and motivates them to move forward, while conscience provides disciplinary limitations and guides individuals towards their destiny 02:29:46.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals can find their calling by identifying the things that bother them, as these problems are often a call to action and a sign of their conscience guiding them towards their destiny 02:30:00.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dynamism between calling and conscience orients individuals upwards and provides guidance, as seen in the symbolic representation of the burning bush and the pillar of flame and darkness that guided the <a href="/item/3df232bc-51d9-4121-8551-7e56a3e2cfbd">Israelites</a> across the desert 02:30:27.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To start making progress, individuals can ask themselves what bothers them about their current situation and identify areas where they can take action to create order and make positive changes 02:30:50.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting small, such as making one's bed in the morning, can be a powerful way to create order and build momentum, even in the midst of chaos 02:31:05.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of creating order and making progress is exponential, meaning that small actions can lead to significant changes over time, and individuals can use this process to move forward even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges 02:31:49.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of devolving a species can occur rapidly due to the accumulation of negative mutations, and a similar concept can be applied to the human psyche, where there are more ways to make something complex worse than better 02:32:12.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that it's easier to make something complex worse than better is an anthropic problem, and this concept can be applied to various aspects of life, including personal development and societal trends 02:32:23.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person's upbringing and life experiences can shape their perspective on the world, as seen in the example of the speaker's father, who grew up in <a href="/item/4d5e8543-249a-452a-b060-4c701cbd2653">Argentina</a> surrounded by political chaos and later became a physicist, valuing order and structure 02:32:32.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker's father once commented on the decline of societal norms, pointing out people wearing casual, sloppy clothing in public, which he saw as a sign of degeneration and a lack of care for oneself and others 02:32:53.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This observation was initially dismissed by the speaker as judgmental, but in hindsight, it's clear that the father was highlighting a narcissistic aspect of people prioritizing their own desires over social norms and expectations 02:33:26.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker acknowledges that people should be able to express themselves through their clothing choices, but notes that the lack of care and effort in one's appearance can be a sign of carelessness rather than a bold statement 02:33:46.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distinction is made between voluntary chaos, which can be a form of self-expression, and degeneration into chaos through sloth, which is a sign of carelessness and a lack of purpose 02:33:53.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker argues that people who prioritize being "cool" and careless are not truly cool, but rather useless and hiding behind a veneer of revolutionary morality 02:34:13.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker's father's observations about societal decline were likely influenced by his experiences growing up in a country that had gone through rough times, and his comments may have been more accurate than initially thought 02:34:50.  </p>

<li>
<p>The <a href="/item/babbb3d6-9721-4da3-8c58-729faa1c2f61">United States</a> is currently at a point where the representation of order versus chaos is disintegrating, with recent public displays of violence, such as assassinations, contributing to this trend 02:35:07.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recent public shooting, allegedly committed by Luigi Manion, who 3D printed a gun, is seen as an attempt to make a statement, with the perpetrator's actions and online presence suggesting a mix of anti-establishment and narcissistic tendencies 02:35:35.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shooter's affinity for the Unibomber and his lack of clear left or right-leaning politics make his motivations difficult to categorize, but his actions suggest a desire for notoriety and a sense of self-importance 02:36:21.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pathological narcissism is a possible explanation for the shooter's behavior, with his academic success and grandiose statements online indicating a sense of intellectual superiority and a tendency to overreach 02:36:45.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shooter's actions are seen as a form of moralizing narcissism, where the individual takes on the role of ultimate judge and decides who lives or dies, with this mindset being deeply embedded in modern culture 02:37:56.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The celebration of the shooter's actions by some is also seen as a reflection of this moralizing narcissism, with individuals taking on the role of vigilantes and judging others without accountability 02:38:00.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trend of individuals taking on the role of judge, jury, and executioner is seen as a response to the perceived failures of institutions, such as the healthcare system, with individuals feeling the need to take matters into their own hands 02:38:16.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The desire for status and notoriety is a driving factor in this trend, with individuals, particularly young men, seeking to make a name for themselves through extreme actions 02:39:05.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast, individuals like <a href="/item/fd0bb156-5928-46bb-8cd6-dbd5f70bb86e">Elon Musk</a>, who are working on big, important projects, such as space exploration, are seen as positive examples of individuals striving for greatness through constructive means 02:39:27.  </p>

<li>
<p>Doing good things, especially long-term ones, is hard because of their long-term nature, but it's also intensely worthwhile when the aim is true and the voyage is worthwhile 02:40:17.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having long-term goals and pursuing them can bring a sense of pleasure and satiation, but if the aim is solely pleasure, it can lead to failure, as seen in the example of a podcaster who would have failed if their aim was solely to pursue pleasure 02:40:46.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The difference between prioritizing short-term pleasure and long-term goals is exemplified by the contrast between being the class clown and being at the top of the class, with the former being easier but ultimately dissolving one's potential 02:41:12.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe Rogan's success as a podcaster is attributed to his pursuit of curiosity and commitment, as he talks to people he wants to talk to about things he wants to discuss, and his podcast was built around him due to the nature of his pursuit 02:41:34.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rogan's podcast started as a response to a comedian stealing jokes, and he stood up for his friend, which led to him being banished from the comedy club, prompting him to start his podcast as a way to stand up for the truth 02:42:32.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rogan's pursuit of truth has been a driving force for his podcast, and he consistently claims not to have all the answers, which is why he listens and asks questions, making him perennially attractive to his audience 02:43:47.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/item/fd0bb156-5928-46bb-8cd6-dbd5f70bb86e">Elon Musk</a> had an existential crisis at a young age, which he resolved by recognizing that the quest for meaning is the source of meaning, and he took it upon himself to confront difficult problems and try to solve them, finding it sufficiently gratifying 02:44:25.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pattern of resolving existential crises through pursuit and commitment is exemplified by <a href="/item/5a5286ac-bcfc-409a-905f-7f4730e29d65">Rogan</a>, the podcaster, and others, and has a significant impact on the public, as seen in the example of 5,000 people attending a biologist's lecture in <a href="/item/3fadb194-dc64-4a3d-a5de-0e30ca2ee94c">Australia</a> 02:45:01.  </p>

<p>A colleague, <a href="/item/50bc84c5-6cc2-4f67-920b-053e78da3bed">Anna Lembke</a>, who wrote the book "Dopamine Nation," discussed how big inflections in dopamine that aren't preceded by effort, such as those caused by drugs or behavioral addictions, can leave individuals below their baseline dopamine levels, leading to further engagement in the behavior 02:46:07.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To find one's purpose, it's essential to start by figuring out how to be of use in progressively larger spheres, beginning with small tasks, such as taking care of one's front lawn 02:46:40.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding purpose is a process that involves being of use in the present and hearing the calling, which eventually reveals itself 02:46:58.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The story of Jacob in the <a href="/item/aee5dd07-2feb-4a3f-885c-73af3ca4e4da">Old Testament</a> illustrates the concept of finding purpose through a decision to be better and aiming up, which leads to a dream that sets him on a path of self-discovery 02:47:43.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To find one's purpose, it's necessary to review one's current state, face the reality of being wretched and miserable, and decide to aim up, even if the path is unclear 02:48:08.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of finding purpose involves making sacrifices, being willing to start with small, trivial tasks, and being open to the pathway revealing itself in increments 02:48:29.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A helpful question to ask oneself when searching for purpose is, "Is there something around here that I could fix that I would fix?" 02:48:41.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone has the opportunity to find purpose, even in the midst of catastrophic messes, and the more unstructured possibility there is, the more potential for growth and self-discovery 02:49:17.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The more problems or messes one can see, the more opportunities there are to clean them up and create a pathway for improvement 02:49:27.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A project assigned to students involved finding something in their neighborhood or family that wasn't right and trying to fix it, which led to complex adventures and personal growth 02:49:51.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One student took on the role of a mother after her death, which led to resistances from the family but ultimately helped the student grow and develop responsibility 02:50:02.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone faces difficult circumstances, but that also means there are many opportunities to make a positive impact and create change 02:50:39.  </p>

<li>
<p>Starting a podcast was a way to share knowledge and provide tools to help people deal with stress, mental health issues, and disrupted social order during the pandemic 02:51:02.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision to start the podcast was driven by a compulsion to share knowledge and a desire to help people regulate their stress and circadian biology through zero-cost tools like deliberate breathing 02:51:05.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The podcast was also motivated by a calling to help people suffering during the pandemic, particularly with issues like lack of sunlight, <a href="/item/03f4eae7-ed6c-47d2-ad43-7f9c033038d0">socialization</a>, and sleep 02:52:17.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision to share knowledge and start the podcast was influenced by a sense of conscience and a feeling of responsibility to use one's knowledge to help others 02:52:35.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting the podcast was a logical extension of a calling to be a teacher and professor, and a desire to share knowledge and help people 02:52:51.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of exploring a broader scale of knowledge transmission is reasonable, given one's existing role as a researcher and professor, and the available technology to do so 02:52:57.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of calling and conscience is closely related, and can be seen as the voice of the <a href="/item/d23d3271-121c-4fcf-9902-9bf28156939d">Divine</a>, which is a characterization repeated in the story of <a href="/item/3cdf9aa4-719c-4b20-bf8d-88bbc1554931">Elijah</a> 02:53:11.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elijah, a prophet in the <a href="/item/eeef1dd6-e593-4c2c-b9f2-b19f833702cb">New Testament</a>, is the first person in human history to identify the Divine with conscience, marking a major psychological revolution in understanding 02:53:29.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elijah is also the originator of the phrase "the still Small Voice," which refers to the notion that one's conscience is the voice of the Divine 02:53:48.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This idea is considered revolutionary, and there is no reason not to take the claim seriously, as it is difficult to come up with an alternative explanation for the voice of conscience that tells one things they do not want to hear 02:54:04.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of conscience as the voice of the Divine is a profound idea that challenges one's understanding of themselves and their relationship with the Divine 02:54:21.  </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Prayer is believed to allow things from outside of oneself to come through and bring out the best in a person, with the goal of establishing aim and clarity of mind 02:54:27.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A daily prayer practice involves praying for clarity of mind, sustained focus, the ability to let go and not control, and allowing randomness and serendipity to guide the conversation 02:54:33.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision to start praying was influenced by a conversation with a security team member about the <a href="/item/a7e2576b-df2f-4570-966e-013654fc9525">Bible</a> and <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">God</a>, which led to reading the Bible and starting a prayer practice about a year and a half ago 02:55:42.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prayer is seen as different from other practices like deliberate breathing, hypnosis, and meditation, as it allows something from outside to come through and bring out the best in a person 02:57:15.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The four things prayed for are ability, other people, and listening, with an emphasis on inviting in or allowing in messages that might not be heard otherwise 02:57:27.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening is a powerful aspect of prayer, and sometimes messages or revelations come through after a period of quiet reflection, such as during sleep or the next morning 02:57:33.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intuition is seen as the voice of one's aim, and listening to intuition can be a form of <a href="/item/cbe8517b-ad3d-47f6-a756-92d8d4ecf150">revelation</a> 02:57:57.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The images that appear to an individual are tools to orient them towards their destination, and they must be useful in guiding the person towards their goal, otherwise, they would be useless. 02:58:12  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifying one's aim is crucial, and the voice of that aim will make itself manifest, which is what a revelation is. 02:58:29  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relationship between thought and prayer is a topic worth exploring, with the idea that thought is secularized prayer, and this concept has historical origins that date back to the development of language, approximately 15,000 years ago. 02:58:42  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having an informative intuition means positing a question, which is a form of humility, and setting the stage for a creative idea to enter one's imagination, enhancing the probability of a revelation. 02:59:25  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessing and discriminating the ideas that arise is a critical thinking process, similar to separating the wheat from the chaff, and is a necessary step in the revelation process. 02:59:49  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of setting one's aim, observing the manifestation of that aim, and experiencing a <a href="/item/cbe8517b-ad3d-47f6-a756-92d8d4ecf150">revelation</a> is not magical, but rather how perception works, although there is a sense of magic in being able to think of something new and original. 03:00:01  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The experience of revelation can be likened to being on one's knees, hoping for an answer, and having a moment of insight, such as when a light bulb goes on, which is a manifestation of the revelation process. 03:00:24  </p>

<p>The human brain's complexity and its inability to fully understand and manage itself without a concept of <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">God</a> is a notion supported by historical evidence, as the idea of God has been a stable feature of human societies for a long time 03:00:38.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different religions and their representations of God may converge on common themes at a psychological and neuroscientific level, despite their differences 03:01:54.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stories, lessons, and teachings of various religions seem to overlap on the same themes, suggesting a deeper convergence 03:02:13.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Atheism can be argued as its own form of religion, and its themes may also converge with those of other religions 03:02:44.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopting a real belief in God and a prayer practice has been beneficial to one's life, providing a sense of stability and integration 03:03:02.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literary theorist <a href="/item/9d944250-1072-4243-a855-aad2f4fd2cf2">Camille Paglia</a> suggested that if the academy had turned to <a href="/item/6c8abf0b-510a-45a0-9e91-7e312574fd32">Eric Neumann</a> instead of <a href="/item/b92d1cad-abc8-42d4-b710-8ae96691de52">Michel Foucault</a>, the history of the university and intellectual enterprise would have been entirely different 03:03:30.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foucault's idea that the story we act out is one of power is considered wrong, as power does not provide a stable basis for psychological integration or social unity 03:04:04.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power may be more effective adaptively than capitulation, but it is not a stable basis for psychological integration or social unity 03:04:27.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of dependence is not an optimized solution, and data demonstrates that it is not ideal, as outlined in a book that explores the patterns of religious thinking found by <a href="/item/6ecfea11-e300-4ef8-a3ef-e0419e8fc9c5">Carl Jung</a>, Eric Neumann, and others 03:04:34.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ancient <a href="/item/8bf1202b-eb0f-42a7-9f75-6488827b9c7f">Egyptians</a> worshiped a <a href="/item/93ccd2d2-68ac-42f0-850c-88c4c88a632d">god</a> named Horus, who is associated with the Open Eye, symbolizing attention, which was seen as the antidote to the pathological state, represented by the god Seth, who later became associated with <a href="/item/c09945ce-c24e-430e-a817-e1761a43dab1">Satan</a> 03:05:07.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Egyptians believed that the degenerate state had a spirit, and the antidote to this spirit was the all-seeing, upward-striving eye, which is similar to the idea of setting one's sights high and striving for the heavens 03:05:55.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a difference between attention and thinking, as attention is a quest for seeking and knocking, whereas thinking is a more passive process 03:06:15.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of the Open Eye is the gateway to seeking and finding, and it is the antidote to the degenerate state, as it seeks rather than tyrannizes 03:06:34.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="/item/9526159a-9e27-458f-8575-f25562e9d8a3">Egyptian</a> theology had a significant impact on <a href="/item/a5722432-abae-4e86-99f6-a8f1b89a05d5">Jewish</a> theology, as the Jews came out of Egypt, and the pattern of the hero's journey is replicated in many cultures that have achieved unity and progress 03:06:50.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a hierarchy of religious truth, just as there is a hierarchy of literary depth, and religious apprehension can be arranged in terms of a hierarchy of quality 03:07:23.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Union school, which includes biologists and neuroscientists, has explored the hierarchy of religious truth and the symbolism of the adventurous spirit 03:07:44.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommended readings for someone interested in psychology and neuroscience include "The Sacred and the Profane" by <a href="/item/d6c33d97-6daa-4c1e-8862-12b8a2220de4">Mircea Eliade</a> and "<a href="/item/84d13bd9-7409-44b5-8963-cc5c52e457e4">The Origins and History of Consciousness</a>" by <a href="/item/6c8abf0b-510a-45a0-9e91-7e312574fd32">Eric Neumann</a>, although the latter is more challenging to understand 03:08:07.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of a war between deities in heaven is a common mythological trope found in multiple cultures, symbolizing the emergence of the integrated human psyche across tens of thousands of years 03:09:05.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This war of ideas between deities is reflected in the actions of human beings as they unite, fight, compete, cooperate, and trade, ultimately leading to a pattern of conflict that tilts towards a monotheistic unity 03:09:54.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As cultures unify, they tend to move towards conceptual unity, which involves the battle between ideas of the <a href="/item/d23d3271-121c-4fcf-9902-9bf28156939d">Divine</a> and their integration into a unified whole, resembling a larger-scale civilization 03:10:28.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This movement towards conceptual unity is part of the proclamation of analytic psychologists, who were influenced by <a href="/item/6ecfea11-e300-4ef8-a3ef-e0419e8fc9c5">Carl Jung</a>, but was largely ignored by the academy except for <a href="/item/9d944250-1072-4243-a855-aad2f4fd2cf2">Camille Paglia</a>, who understands this concept profoundly 03:10:44.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The integration of deities and the movement towards monotheism can be seen as a reflection of the human desire for unity and the establishment of a larger-scale civilization 03:10:36.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pattern of conflict between deities and the movement towards unity is a stable pattern found across cultures, indicating a deeper human desire for integration and cooperation 03:10:08.  </p>

<p>The concept of Adlerian psychology is very practical and serves as a counterpoint to <a href="/item/41d49d26-7196-4780-92ec-497aa1f2da2c">Freud</a> and Jung, focusing on the idea of life tasks and discarding thoughts about prior trauma 03:12:02.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A book titled "The Courage to Be Disliked" explores Adlerian psychology through a conversation between a philosopher and a student, raising challenges to the idea of life tasks and the importance of focusing on the present 03:12:09.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The book's concept of embracing tasks and moving forward, rather than dwelling on past traumas, aligns with the idea of getting serious about one's tasks and progressing forward 03:13:03.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adler's approach is seen as a good response to Freud's focus on sex, with Adler focusing on power and Jung focusing on what transcends both 03:14:03.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For those interested in Adler, Freud, and Jung, a recommended book is "<a href="/item/a638fd57-3a3d-436c-9376-5f7d25a80f4b">The Discovery of the Unconscious</a>" by <a href="/item/0da4d33a-cef8-48db-ad8d-18f88df22ec0">Henri Ellenberger</a>, a prominent exponent of existential psychology 03:14:18.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The book "The Discovery of the Unconscious" is a masterful study that provides the best analysis of Freud, Jung, and Adler, tracing the idea of the unconscious back 350 years before Freud 03:14:30.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adler's work is practically oriented and fits well with a bottom-up approach that a behaviorally oriented psychotherapist would employ, making him a good choice for those looking for a psychologist to help advance their life 03:14:44.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who are high in trait openness are best engaged with at the level of concept, and Jung's psychology works well on highly creative people, while Freud's work is more suitable for those with sexual dysfunction and trauma as their primary preoccupation 03:15:21.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adler's writing style is not as literary as Jung's or Freud's, which may have contributed to his relatively lower recognition, but his work is still valuable for those looking for practical advice on advancing their life 03:16:08.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a lack of a satisfactory book on neuroscience, the mind, and psychology that combines these fields in a comprehensive way, with the closest example being "Affective Neuroscience" by <a href="/item/d0ce7553-93d7-4cdb-b768-291b7dbde24a">Jaak Panksepp</a> 03:16:59.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jaak Panksepp's work on affective neuroscience is highly valued, and his research on juvenile play as a way of exploring circuitry and social dynamics has been influential in understanding childhood <a href="/item/03f4eae7-ed6c-47d2-ad43-7f9c033038d0">socialization</a> 03:17:09.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Panksepp's work has been recognized for its contribution to science, but he may not have received the same level of recognition as other luminaries in neuroscience due to his affiliation with a smaller university 03:17:55.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A researcher had a keen eye for identifying the right problems to investigate in psychology and was brave in pursuing those topics, such as studying laughter in rats, which may seem absurd at first but led to significant discoveries 03:18:14.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The research on rats found that they organize their social hierarchy through play, not force, which is a major discovery that reveals an implicit morality in rats 03:18:43.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This concept of implicit morality based on play is also observed in children and chimpanzees, and it's notable that functional dominance hierarchies are often organized through play rather than force 03:19:07.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The researcher's findings, including the discovery about rats, were significant enough to warrant a <a href="/item/dc4fa538-b27e-4795-b9e6-58add932c066">Nobel Prize</a>, but unfortunately, that recognition was not received 03:18:49.  </p>

<p>The antithesis of tyranny is play, which is a concept that took a long time to realize, especially after studying evil intensely since the age of 13 03:19:43.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evil is easier to define than good, and it's challenging to find a category that integrates all that's good, but play seems to be a pretty good summation 03:19:51.  </p>

<li>
<p>The optimally superordinate nature of play makes itself manifest when watching someone who's a master at their task, and individuals like Musk and <a href="/item/f11a078d-9c62-4821-93e3-a19edb2c26d3">Trump</a> display this playful nature 03:20:39.  </p>

<li>
<p>Many young people are discouraged from engaging in real discourse due to the fear of being either the one who "dunks" on someone or gets "dunked" on, but there is room for optimism with the rise of alternative media, which features many comedians and podcasters, such as <a href="/item/5a5286ac-bcfc-409a-905f-7f4730e29d65">Joe Rogan</a>, <a href="/item/5ca386dc-094a-4b10-ad71-a96753bd5dbd">Russell Brand</a>, and <a href="/item/17a426ea-9c1e-40b0-a143-64cb567dd865">Dave Rubin</a>, who have become extremely successful 03:23:38.  </p>

<li>
<p>The alternative media has been gaining power, and the legacy media's foothold is dying, with podcasters like Joe Rogan being able to have a significant impact, such as his conversation with <a href="/item/f11a078d-9c62-4821-93e3-a19edb2c26d3">Donald Trump</a>, which was seen as a serious and significant event 03:25:12.  </p>

<p>Theo is admired for being genuine, intelligent, and having a unique combination of being from an underclass background and being smart, making him relatable and entertaining to watch 03:27:19.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current <a href="/item/bc04aa04-10b3-438e-a5ee-18915ebbce9c">Republican</a> movement is considered to be in uncharted territory and not conceptualized in terms of the normal political dichotomy, with the hope that the <a href="/item/59d595b7-7de8-4d11-bb2a-ed4720d715ab">Democrats</a> will get their act together to serve as a proper opposition 03:28:34.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A strong and formidable Democratic party is necessary to counter the Republican party and prevent power from corrupting, as it always does when there is no credible opposition 03:29:24.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lack of an effective opposition could lead to the Republicans running amok, and it is in their own interest to have someone to point out their mistakes 03:29:43.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An invitation is extended to the Democrats to engage in discussions and express their views, as many people in the alternative media world have expressed similar sentiments 03:29:54.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fear of being cancelled has chased people with real courage out of the Democratic party, making it difficult for them to appear on podcasts or engage in discussions 03:30:17.  </p>

</li>

<p>The concept of a self-declared Democrat trying to replicate Joe's approach is unlikely to be successful, as it would require them to figure out what the opposition to this new type of <a href="/item/bc04aa04-10b3-438e-a5ee-18915ebbce9c">Republican</a> should be and put forward an attractive vision 03:31:49.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that the <a href="/item/59d595b7-7de8-4d11-bb2a-ed4720d715ab">Democrats</a> are the true voice of the working class is questioned, with the suggestion that this may no longer be the case and that there is an opportunity for the Democrats to forge a new path 03:32:08.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of learning and adapting in order to be successful in the podcast world is emphasized, with the need to be able to express one's true thoughts and opinions without fear of reputation damage 03:32:41.  </p>

<p>The value of embracing fear and anxiety about the unknown is highlighted, with the suggestion that this is a necessary part of growth and development, particularly for young people 03:33:44.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that it's okay to start something new and not be perfect, and that embracing the role of "fool" can be a powerful way to learn and improve, is discussed, with the suggestion that people are more likely to forgive and make allowances for ignorance that is voluntarily admitted to 03:34:02.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of being able to laugh at oneself and admit to mistakes is emphasized, with the suggestion that this can be a powerful way to build character and credibility 03:34:39.  </p>
