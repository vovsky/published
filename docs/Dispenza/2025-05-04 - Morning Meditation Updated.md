Take a moment and find your center. Inhale, become aware of your breath, and exhale, and relax. It's time to be defined by a vision of the future.

Instead of the memories of the past, and to move into a new state of being. And now, can you become aware of the space between your ears in space? And now, can you sense the space beyond your ears in space? And can you move your attention to the space in the center of your throat in space? And can you become aware of the energy of space around your throat, beyond your neck in space? And now, can you rest your awareness in space, behind your breastbone in space? And can you feel the volume of space beyond your shoulders in space? And now, can you sense the space between your shoulders and the room you are in, in space? And can you become aware that you're aware in space? And now, what was that vision of the future that awaits you? Be defined by that intention, and select that potential that already exists in the field. And allow that internal representation to be where you're headed.

Invest your energy into the future. And let the thought become the experience. And let the experience create the emotion.

And can you teach your body emotionally how that future feels now? And move into a new state of being. Come on, open your heart and let your body respond to a new mind. And it's time to step in to that future now.

What choices will you make today? What things will you do? What experiences await you? And how will they feel? Priming your brain and body into the future. Stay in the feeling. It's time to remind yourself of who you no longer want to be.

What thoughts will you become conscious of that will never slip by your awareness today? What choices will you not make? What behaviors will you no longer demonstrate? What experiences will you stay away from? And what emotions and feelings will you no longer embrace that will cause you to return back to feeling like the familiar self? And become the observer from a greater level of mind. And now, finally, it's time one more time to invest your energy into the future. Come on.

Combining a clear intention with an elevated emotion. Come on, open your heart and change your energy. And when you change your energy, you change your life.

For whatever you brought past, into the field, is your experiment with destiny. Being defined by a vision of the future, instead of the memory of the past, means that you're ahead of your time. Take your hand and place it over your heart.

And in a moment, take a breath. And have compassion and care and kindness towards your beautiful self. Giving thanks for a new life.

And the longer you linger in gratitude, the more you draw your new life to you. And if, in fact, you emulated the divine today and made contact with it, that you ask for a sign from this consciousness, this loving intelligence. And that it bring it to you in a way that you least expect.

That surprises you. And that it leaves no doubt that it came from this mind. And that you are inspired to do it again and again when it finds you.

In unexpected ways. And now, bring your awareness back to a new body. To a new environment.

And to a whole new time. And when you're ready, you can open your eyes.
