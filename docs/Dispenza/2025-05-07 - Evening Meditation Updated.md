Sit up straight, and for a moment, find your center, and take a breath in through your heart, and breathe life into your body, and as you exhale now, let go of the day. And another, with awareness, inhaling and feeling your body as you exhale, and as you draw your attention to your breath, and exhale and relax. And can you become aware of the space behind your in space? And can you sense the energy of space, your body in space? Become aware of the space in front, and can you feel the energy of space, the front? And now, the space beyond your shoulders, beyond your reach in space.

And now, it's time to look at yourself through the eyes of someone else, and observe the choices you made today, the behaviors you demonstrated, to notice the thoughts that you were thinking, the experiences. Where did you fall from grace? Did you go unconscious? In certain situations? Simply, observe. What emotion? What experiences? New day tomorrow? How? Would you do it if you had another chance? Do you want to believe it, and accept it, and surrender to it? What choices could you make? How could you act? A vision of the future that would lead to those experiences that await you.

Feel. If you mastered a little more of yourself, would love do, greatness do, strength live into your future? What piece of knowledge could you apply in those past experiences of the day that it would evolve you towards your destiny? Mental rehearsal primes the brain and body. It's important to review your choices, the better choices. 

Remind yourself of your behaviors with your new destiny. Invest your attention and your energy into the future new experiences by fueling those events, emotions ahead of the experience. Evolution.

Integrate it into your brain and body. Reminding yourself. Installing the neurological circuitry and conditioning your body subconsciously toward that destiny. 

And for a moment now, surrender. Let go. Now let's review and celebrate new thoughts that you embraced. 

The new choices and the behaviors demonstrated that matched your intention and your vision. The new experiences, be they small or large, that were new and novel. How you felt today that was different than yesterday. 

Love yourself for those changes. Observe for a moment what you love about yourself. You loved yourself enough to be greater than your environment, to be greater than your body, and to be greater than time.

Better choices always lead to a different life. Surrender for wisdom, for strength to live defined as a vision of the future instead of being placed over your heart. And bless yourself for your efforts, beauty for you. 

Demonstrate a more evolved understanding of yourself for the opportunity. Lay down this evening and consolidate the new memories, the new experiences, your body. Embrace the new chemistry and emotions. 

Change yourself. Be rich and Muslim. Blessed in you.
