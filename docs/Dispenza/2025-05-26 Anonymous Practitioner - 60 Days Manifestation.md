# Dr. Joe Dispenza Meditation: 60 Days of Manifestation

## Introduction

This document outlines a 60-day experience practicing **Dr. Joe Dispenza’s "Tuning into New Potentials" meditation**. It is structured into three key areas:

1. Why I did it  
2. How I did it  
3. What I manifested

---

## 1. Why I Did It

I had no consistent meditation practice before this. Although I'd dabbled in meditation and knew of its benefits—especially regarding manifestation and quantum field theories—I had never committed to it regularly.

### Motivation

- I’m naturally wired and run my own business. I find it hard to relax or sleep.
- I realized that **meditation is a core component in making manifestation real**.
- I needed a **bold but achievable timeframe** to commit, and 60 days was long enough to feel transformational yet short enough to feel real.

### Realistic Goal Setting

- Many people set goals too far in the future and can’t emotionally connect to them.
- I chose goals that were:
  - Big enough to feel uncomfortable  
  - Close enough to emotionally engage with  
  - Achievable within a tangible timeframe

## 2. How I Did It

### Time of Day

- Optimal hours for meditation are between **1:00 AM and 4:00 AM**, due to **melatonin production**, which supports deeper states of consciousness.
- I couldn’t always meditate during those hours, but tried to do it **as close as possible**:
  - Typically between **11:00 PM and midnight**
  - Sometimes at **5:00 AM or 6:00 AM**
  - Alternated between late night and early morning

### Physical Setup

- Initially unsure where or how to sit:
  - Tried sitting on the sofa, on a chair, and on the floor
  - Didn’t know what to do with my hands or posture
- Eventually used a **pillow on the floor**, which allowed me to sit cross-legged more comfortably:
  - Helped reduce discomfort in hamstrings and calves
  - Allowed me to stay present and enter deeper meditative states

### Adaptation Curve

- It took **25 days** to have my first deep, effective meditation.
- Early sessions were distracted, uncomfortable, and shallow.
- Persistence was key: I stayed with it despite surface-level frustrations.

## 3. What I Manifested

### New Potential 1: Large Financial Sum

- I visualized a **large but reasonable sum of money** (exact amount undisclosed):
  - Enough to buy and renovate a house
  - Provide for my family and possibly purchase an investment property
- The motivation:
  - My child was about to be born
  - I wanted to create the stability I never had growing up

**Visualization Process**:

- I imagined:
  - Money entering my bank account (specifically **Monzo**, UK online bank)
  - Seeing the **green digits** increase in balance
  - The emotional reaction to seeing the funds arrive
  - Buying a house, growing crops in the garden, family memories
  - Deeply emotionalized and detailed imagery

### New Potential 2: £10,000 Monthly Income

- Goal: Achieve **£10,000/month profit in my business**
- Motivation: To create a **sustainable lifestyle**:
  - Spend time with family
  - Travel, dine out, and enjoy life
- I worked out what income level would support that lifestyle and meditated on it daily

---

## The Results

- **New Potential 1** was achieved:
  - A piece of land with unexpected value came to my wife and me from a **foreign country**
  - We sold it, gaining the exact financial sum needed to fulfill the vision
- **New Potential 2** was also realized:
  - In **month 2**, I earned **£11,600 profit** in my business—the first time reaching over £10k/month

---

## Reflections and Key Takeaways

### Why It Worked

- **Clarity**: I was crystal clear about what I wanted
- **Emotionalization**: The more I felt it emotionally, the more real it became
- **Visualization**: I didn’t just see the result; I **lived it in my mind**

### Emotional Leverage

- You may not get emotional about “£10,000” — but you can about:
  - **Freedom from alarms**
  - **Enjoying coffee in a café**
  - **Spending unstructured time with family**

### The Formula

- Clarity + Visualization + Emotionalization = Manifestation
- The clearer and more emotionally resonant the vision, the more powerful the outcome

---

## Summary

- **60 days** was a transformative threshold:
  - Built discipline and consistency
  - Created space for results to manifest
- I used **strategic timing** to enhance melatonin-driven deep states
- I manifested **exactly what I intended**:
  - A major financial windfall
  - A recurring monthly income milestone

---

## Final Thoughts

If you're considering trying a similar practice:

- Choose a **goal that’s big but believable**
- Meditate during **melatonin-rich hours** (late night or early morning)
- Get **specific and emotional** about your vision
- Stay **consistent for at least 60 days**

> “The more you can emotionalize and visualize, the more you can draw it to you.”

The author specifically used **Dr. Joe Dispenza’s "Tuning into New Potentials" meditation**.

This meditation is one of the core guided practices from Dr. Dispenza's work, typically found in his:
- **"Blessing of the Energy Centers" series**    
- **"Tuning into New Potentials"** audio meditation (standalone or part of his workshop bundles)
    
- It’s designed to help you connect with and emotionally embody new, desired realities using the framework of the **quantum field**, where thought, emotion, and energy converge to influence matter.
