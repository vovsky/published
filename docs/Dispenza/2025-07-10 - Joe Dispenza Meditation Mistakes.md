##  Key Insight: The Power of State of Being

> "You don't get what you want, you get who you are." — Dr. Joe Dispenza

This talk dives deep into common mistakes people make when meditating, especially when trying to manifest abundance or personal change. The speaker shares a personal journey of three years of unproductive meditation and the transformations that followed once the correct principles were applied.

---

##  Mistake #1: Meditating in Survival Mode

- **Definition**: Attempting to meditate while physiologically and mentally in a state of fight/flight (stress, anxiety, fear).
- **Symptoms**:
  - Tense posture (tight shoulders, clenched jaw, shallow breathing).
  - Mentally obsessed with problems, bills, lack, etc.
  - Brain in high-beta (analytical) wave states, unable to relax.

> "I was literally doing bicep curls with my anxiety every morning."

- **Impact**: Reinforces the exact neural pathways that correspond to lack and fear — literally programming the subconscious mind to stay broke.
- **Dr. Joe's Point**: Brain in survival mode is evolutionarily designed to focus on threats, not possibilities.
- **Solution**: Regulate nervous system first. Shift to *creation mode* before meditating.

---

## 🌬️ Nervous System Regulation: The Prerequisite

- **Technique**: Coherent breathing (e.g. 4 seconds in, 4 seconds out, hold as needed).
- **Goal**: Restore physiological homeostasis and shift into a relaxed, receptive mode.
- **Why it works**:
  - Calms the vagus nerve.
  - Establishes heart-brain coherence.
  - Opens access to intuitive and creative states.

> *"Your nervous system doesn't care about spiritual intentions. It only responds to physiology."*

---

##  Mistake #2: Focusing on What You *Don't* Want

- **Common Phrasing in Journals**:
  - "I want to be debt-free"
  - "I want to stop being anxious"
  - "I don't want to worry about money"

- **Problem**:
  - These phrases still energetically anchor the mind in the *undesired* reality.
  - The subconscious doesn't process negatives — "Don't be broke" = "Be broke."

> "It’s like telling someone not to think about a pink elephant."

- **Solution**: Frame intentions positively and in present-tense identity-based language:
  - "I am abundant."
  - "I am calm, confident, and at peace."
  - "I am someone who manages money with ease."

---

##  Mistake #3: Thinking > Feeling (Overtrying to Manifest)

- **Trying too hard = Evidence you don't already have it**
- **Problem**:
  - Mental rehearsal was full of stress.
  - Straining, forcing the outcome leads to energetic resistance.

> "I gave myself a headache trying to manifest."

- **Insight**:
  - Manifestation isn't a struggle. It's about aligning state of being.
  - Like trying to fall asleep by *thinking harder* about sleep — backfires.
- **Alternative**:
  - Relax into the *feeling* of already having.
  - Practice becoming that version of yourself *now*.

---

##  Mistake #4: Focusing on Outcomes Instead of Identity

- **Key Principle**: You manifest who you *are*, not what you want.
- **Old Approach**:
  - Visualize $50k in the bank.
  - Visualize a successful business.
- **New Approach**:
  - Become someone who naturally creates abundance.
  - Embody traits: confidence, trust, responsibility, joy.

> "If your identity is someone bad with money, you will keep being bad with money — even if you meditate on wealth."

- **Identity-Based Questions**:
  - How does an abundant person carry themselves?
  - How do they think, feel, and act in everyday decisions?

---

##  Mistake #5: Expecting Immediate Results

- **Problem**: Expecting external proof of success too soon.
  - E.g., Meditate for a week, check bank account expecting miracles.
- **Why this fails**:
  - Reinforces doubt and impatience.
  - Like checking the mirror for abs after one gym session.

> "It’s not that meditation doesn’t work — I was doing it wrong."

- **Reality Check**:
  - Neural pathways take *time* to rewire (neuroplasticity).
  - Old patterns = highways; new ones = forest trails.
- **What Worked**:
  - Focused on *internal shifts* — e.g., less anxiety, more trust.
  - Noticed behavioral changes (saying no to low-paying clients, raising rates).

##  Recap: The 5 Common Meditation Mistakes

1. **Meditating in survival mode** → Regulate first.
2. **Focusing on lack/problem** → Focus on desired state.
3. **Trying too hard** → Shift to being/receiving mode.
4. **Outcome-focused** → Shift to identity-focused.
5. **Expecting quick results** → Trust the long-term internal transformation.

---

##  Final Reflections & Questions to Self

- Am I meditating in **survival** or **creation** mode?
- Am I focused on **lack** or **abundance**?
- Am I thinking about what I *don’t* want or what I *do* want?
- Am I trying too hard, or am I relaxed and trusting?
- Am I visualizing an **outcome**, or becoming a **new identity**?
- Am I rushing results, or am I surrendering to the process?

##  Conclusion

Meditation isn’t just about sitting still — it's about shifting your **state of being**. Without that, you might be reinforcing the very struggles you're trying to escape. When practiced with awareness, clarity, and emotional alignment, meditation becomes a tool not just for peace, but for transformation.

> "The meditation didn't fail. I was failing at meditation — because I was doing it from the wrong state."
