Let me share a few things from my experience, which I am sure, just to be clear format-wise, diverged quite a bit from what you are describing in terms of best practices, duration of IV, etc.

## Clinical Setting Choice

I chose a clinical setting for a number of reasons:

1. I wanted to make it as **inconvenient as possible** for me to use ketamine — we’ll come back to that.
2. I wanted to **standardize the experience** and have the versatility that IV provides (which is not the case with intramuscular injections).

This allowed me, during a therapy conversation with a therapist, to **dial up the rate of administration** mid-session. I remember very clearly increasing the rate by about 20–25% — suddenly things got very strange:

- There was a **distinct lag** between my thoughts, my mouth moving, and me hearing any sound.
- It became difficult to talk — like having a delayed reverb on a microphone.

I remember saying:

> “John (the technician, a former medic), things are getting a little bendy. Could you please dial back?”

He was able to reduce the rate, and I could resume the session.

## The Session Setup

- Intake process was done beforehand.
- I was placed in a **recliner**, in a private room.
- There was a **big screen TV** where you could choose a **nature video** with music.
- I standardized on a **Redwood forest video**.

This was the **first time I had ever watched a video** in a serious or clinical setting during drug administration, which was novel to me.

## Dose Escalation and Post-Session Effects

- We **gradually escalated the dose**, starting well below the minimum effective dose, then increasing over time.

**Post-session effects included**:

- Recurring short-term memory loss.
- I would forget something every time:
  - My wallet, phone, or backpack.
- At home, I’d misplace items or forget where I left them.

This became a running joke with my girlfriend.

## Questions Raised

1. **How common is cognitive deficit or short-term memory impairment** after ketamine use?
2. **What does a clinical setting typically look like** in supervised ketamine sessions?

## Clinical Responses (From Interview Guest)

### On Clinical Settings

- Clinical setups vary:
  - Some use **blank rooms**, others use **music**, **eye shades**, or **ambient visuals**.
- The goal: **maximize accessibility and efficiency**.

In the clinic co-led by Dr. Robert Ostroff and Gerard Sanacora:

- Setup resembles a **surgical recovery room** with:
  - Multiple bays.
  - Patients shielded by curtains.
  - Medical staff circulating between patients.

It creates a **quasi-communal experience**, though not necessarily by design.

### On Sensory Input

- Ketamine **distorts perception** — the more sensory input, the more distorted the experience becomes.
- In contrast:
  - **LSD** intensifies under sensory **deprivation**.
  - **PCP and ketamine** lead to greater distortion with **increased sensory input**.
  
So, managing the **level of stimulation** is crucial.

## Designing an Optimal Setting (If Cost & Scale Were Not an Issue)

If cost and scalability were irrelevant:

- The focus would still be on **minimizing input**.
- However, having a **comfortable, private, and quiet setting** would likely improve outcomes.
- A **recliner**, **gentle nature video**, **low stimulation**, and **supportive environment** would closely resemble an optimized setting.

## Reflections on Media Use During Sessions

- Watching video during ketamine treatment was novel.
- One issue: **unexpected or mismatched emotional tones** in the video content.

> "There was one scene in the Redwood video with a fox sitting on a freezing cold beach. It looked absolutely miserable — not conducive to an optimal experience."

At higher doses, this became emotionally impactful in an unintended way. The inability to stop the video mid-session made the experience feel like a **ride you couldn’t exit**, similar to being strapped into a Disney ride.

## Closing Thoughts

- Content shown during sessions must be **carefully curated**.
- The **emotional tone of background media** can significantly influence the clinical experience.
- There’s a delicate balance between **stimulating** and **overwhelming** sensory input during psychedelic-assisted therapy.
