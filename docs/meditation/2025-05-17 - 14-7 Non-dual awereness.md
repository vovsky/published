Some traditions say that the real nature of awareness is that it's entirely all-pervading, absolutely everywhere, and that, in and of itself, it's empty, or pure, or clear, and it's capable of holding absolutely anything and everything that arises. But it itself is without characteristics, and therefore it's non-dual, because it doesn't oppose anything against anything else. Non-dual awareness. 

So let's see if we can maybe get a little taste of this in this session. So, settling in, coming into stillness, coming into quiet. Imagine that your body is like a town by the seashore.

Imagine that a mist is rolling in off the sea, and that mist is non-dual awareness, all-pervasive, all-inclusive awareness. And it's rolling in off the sea into the streets of your body. Feel it gently invading your body, like a sea mist gently moving through the streets of a seaside town.

Feel non-dual awareness gently pervading your experience, your sense of being here. Feel that this inclusive non-dual awareness has infiltrated you, has infiltrated the whole field of your experience. Non-dual awareness has no past, no future, only now.

And it includes everything. Let this non-dual awareness pervade you, fill you, spread all through your experience, calming you and energising you in equal measure. Sometimes we lose all sense of distance, everything's equally present.

Sometimes it's as if we have no centre, there's just a warm presence gently buzzing all through experience. We don't have to do anything, just welcome awareness. Okay, so when you feel ready, let's bring this meditation to a close.

Once again, thank you for trying these practices out, in this case allowing non-dual awareness to pervade our experience. For sure, some of these sessions will work for us more than others. Please don't worry if some of them aren't speaking to you.

The important thing is just to keep moving. There's a saying in Zen, if you walk in the mist, you get wet. If we keep doing our practice, gradually things start to stick.

Have a great day.
