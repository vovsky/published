So welcome back to another sit in our retreat on effortlessness. So in this one we're going to directly engage with the sense of effort, getting to know it better, allowing it to be present, and letting it merge with the whole of our experience here and now, so that we don't get into a situation where we're kind of making an effort to have no effort. Okay, come into a comfortable seated position, relax completely, arrive here, become present, and let's become aware that just now there is no need to make any effort at all.

No effort required. Perhaps you're getting a sense of pervasive effortlessness, or perhaps you're finding that some sense of effort is present. If you are finding that, see if you can detect it as a sensation in the body, and simply let it be present, allow it, and welcome it.

Again, if there is some sense of effort, of needing to do something, of trying to do something, what's it like if that's simply part of the whole field of your experience? That's perfectly welcome and free to arise. What's it like if there's no need to make any effort to get rid of effort? We can just rest as things are. The whole field of experience can be just as it is.

What's it like when there's no need to change anything? When there's no effort in any direction? Is it possible to rest in a state of no effort at all? Whatever is arising, even effort, is fine. There's a greater, wider welcome that we can offer to everything. Effortless, wide open.

Just letting yourself bask and soak in the wide field of experience right now. Letting yourself be absorbed by it. What's it like to have no effort arising? No effort present? Great, thank you so much. 

So letting some movement come back into the body, opening up to being present here, where we are. Perhaps just exploring whether you can become more aware of the distinction between effort and effortlessness through your day. Have a great day.
