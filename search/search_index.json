And how you think, how you act, and how you feel is your personality, and your personality is intimately connected to your personal reality, your life. So then if you want to change your life, your personal reality, you've got to change your personality.</p> <p>And here we go again, you've got to start becoming conscious of your unconscious thoughts. Just write those down and say, these thoughts, like Gandalf on the bridge, you may not pass today, this is the end. So then if you become conscious of those thoughts, now you're the governor of your thoughts.</p> <p>Less than 2% of the Americans actually write their intentions or goals down. The ones that do actually write them down, they have an 80% chance of reaching those goals if they write them down. So when you write something down, you're telling your brain that you mean it.</p> <p>It's a direction that you're moving, and it has to be ongoing. And it's a to be statement. A to be statement is something that you're evolving into.</p> <p>Once you get clear on your intention, sponsoring thoughts, the list of reasons why you want to be healthy, because those sponsoring thoughts are really going to be the driving force to get you going in that direction. If it's healthy, you may want to have vitality. You may want to look better.</p> <p>If it's wealth, you want freedom, freedom to do whatever you want, right? So when you begin to define your intention and you couple it with a sponsoring thought, now you're giving your body a taste emotionally of what that future is going to be like. Now the next step is to plan your actions. Master your day, one day at a time.</p> <p>So now you've already dismantled an old part of yourself and you say, today the thought I'm going to have is that I'm a genius and I accomplish everything. Or I live in no time, the universe provides for me. The universe lives in my favor.</p> <p>Different compartments of the brain begin to unify, they begin to synchronize. And what syncs in the brain links in the brain. So when your brain is coherent, you're coherent.</p> <p>When your brain is incoherent, you are incoherent. So we've measured this thousands of times. We'll see very large areas of the brain.</p> <p>Huge areas begin to synchronize together. Then we'll see the left side of the brain talk to the right side of the brain. We'll see the front part of the brain talk to the back part.</p> <p>We'll see this kind of whole brain state start to take place. And I see it every time. They feel so complete that it's impossible to want.</p> <p>How can you want when you're whole? And that's the moment the magic happens. We see a strip chart, we're measuring someone's brain and all of a sudden we just see this Brrrr And then there'll be a pause. And then 10 minutes later, brrrr And we know that's downloads.</p> <p>The person is having epiphanies, they're having downloads. We're getting raw information that's beyond our senses. The nervous system really is the superconductor of consciousness.</p> <p>Let's break down the feelings of how you would feel if that future happened. And you're going to have to feel that feeling before it occurs. So now, okay, what does an abundant person feel? Pretty much free, in love with life, grateful to be alive, abundant.</p> <p>Okay, now, let's practice. The moment you feel gratitude, your healing begins. The moment you feel worthy and abundant, you're generating wealth.</p> <p>The moment you're empowered, you are moving towards your success. The moment you're in love with yourself and you're in love with life, you'll create an equal. The moment you are in awe of life, you're going to have a mystical experience.</p> <p>And so, that's causing an effect, right? So then, if you can teach people, then, how to create, instead of from lack or separation, but create from wholeness, and create from what we call the quantum field, instead of three-dimensional reality. Okay, the quantum field is an invisible field of energy that exists beyond our senses. You can't see it, you can't smell it, you can't taste it, you can't hear it, you can't feel it.</p> <p>It exists beyond our experience of three-dimensional reality. And how much of your waking day are you aware of energy and frequency? For most people, they're unaware of the quantum field. And if you're unaware of it, it doesn't exist for you.</p> <p>You could study all kinds of science and they'll tell you there is this invisible field of frequency and energy that exists beyond the senses that tend to connect everything physical and material. In fact, everything physical and material is connected to this field. How do you get there? So we discovered that when you take all of your attention off your body, you are not paying attention to your emotions, your drives, your habits.</p> <p>If you could take all of your attention off of every element in your environment, your cell phone, your tablet, your computer, your car, your bed, take your attention away from everything, every place that you live, or you sleep, or you work, there tends to be a dramatic change in the way the brain functions when people do this properly. We call it getting beyond yourself. But in a sense, you're dissociating from your three-dimensional reality.</p> <p>Why? Because if you're thinking about anything in your three-dimensional reality, that's where your attention is and that's where your energy is. And when I can stay in that place of uncertainty and unknown, and I can transmute that energy into piety or gratitude, and I can get my energy up, even though there's chaos around me, then I'm filling that void between the old self and the new self with information. And when you change your energy, you change your life.</p> <p>In other words, you're so busy being elevated, know that you can't predict what's going to happen, you're just very clear you're not gonna go back to those familiar cravings and familiar urges. We'll begin to help you get clear on the direction that you're moving and allow that energy to push you. Now, that energy is like the flame in the alchemist's crucible.</p> <p>It's going to turn base metals into gold. It's gonna remove the dross. And so purification comes with quite a bit of agitation.</p> <p>There's gotta be a stirring that takes place. And I think that most of us in the last year or two have felt this incredible stirring inside of ourselves. And that's because the energy is so intense that our nervous systems have to really adapt to it.</p> <p>So I think our purpose in life is really to remove these layers, these masks, these habits and emotions that block the flow of the divine within us. Every morning when you start your day, before you open your eyes and reach for your cell phone and check your WhatsApp and your texts and your Facebook, before you plug yourself back into your same familiar world, sit there and get very clear on what that future will be like and begin to emotionally embrace it before it happens. And if you do that properly, you're moving into a new state of being.</p> <p>First thing I would have people do is to really decide what they want in their life. I mean, that's the first step. Decide what your future could look like.</p> <p>Get clear on what that vision is and write down the specifics of what you want in your life, whether it's with your family or your career or with a relationship, whatever it is. Get clear on what that vision is of yourself in the future. And then write down the emotions of how you'll feel when it happens.</p> <p>Will you be joyful? Will you be enthusiastic? Will you be filled with energy? Will you love your life and be in constant state of gratitude? And now you have a clear intention and elevated emotion. So then most people think in the past and feelings and emotions are the end product of past experiences. So if you're feeling the same way every single day, it means nothing new is happening in your life.</p> <p>And if those feelings are driving your thoughts, then you're thinking in the past. So most people's biology, for the most part, living in the past. By the time we're 35 years old is a set of memorized behaviors and emotional reactions, beliefs, perceptions, pretty much on autopilot.</p> <p>That's 95% of most people. So their 5% is working against 95% of what they've memorized subconsciously. So the first step then is becoming conscious of your unconscious thoughts, becoming aware of your automatic behaviors, and then noticing and paying attention to the emotions that you feel every day.</p> <p>When you begin to free yourself from the chains of those addictive emotions, you begin to open your heart, the field around your body, the heart begins to produce a magnetic field that sometimes can go to nine meters wide. And if you can teach a person how to feel an elevated emotion and sustain it, and they begin to like drop pebbles in water over and over again, and they start to produce these beautiful waves. If they feel deeply and richly and profoundly, they're dropping big stones that are producing bigger waves.</p> <p>Now those waves are energy. And energy is frequency, and all frequency carries information like radio waves and cell phone waves. What those waves carry is your thought, your intent.</p> <p>So now the carrier of your own vibrational patterns to begin to carry information that is going to begin to influence matter. People are afraid of, because they'd rather live in guilt. At least they can predict who they're gonna be than take a chance in possibility.</p> <p>You have to really begin to mentally rehearse ask yourself at the end of your day, I do this every day, how'd I do? First thing you have to do is you have to decide, are you gonna be defined by a vision of the future? Or are you gonna live by the memories of the past? Now thoughts are the language of the brain and feelings are the language of the body and how you think and how you feel creates your state of being. So we could say that most people's entire state of being when they start their day is in the familiar past. Well, if you live in the familiar past, then it makes sense you're gonna create a predictable future.</p> <p>Your body is your unconscious mind. Some people would rather cling to the familiar than take a chance in possibility. For most people then they say, well, I don't really see how my thoughts have anything to do with my destiny.</p> <p>Well, that's because 95% of those thoughts are subconscious programs, right? So you're not even conscious that you think those thoughts. So the first step to change is starting to think about what you've been thinking about and change it. And then when you begin to observe those thoughts, now the game is on, right? Because now you're working to become conscious of that and not go unconscious again.</p> <p>And it takes an incredible amount of awareness. It takes a great amount of consciousness and you can't have consciousness without energy. So you gotta raise your energy in order to get to it.</p> <p>Otherwise you're gonna be consumed. You're gonna return back, right? So if you start becoming familiar, so conscious of those unconscious thoughts, they would never slip by your mind and check by you. Because if you combine a clear intention, a coherent thought, coherent brainwave pattern, with a coherent heart, moving into that elevated emotion, thoughts are electric and feelings are magnetic.</p> <p>The magnetism of this center becomes the energy. The intention is carried on that energy. And now you are broadcasting a new signature into the quantum field.</p> <p>When you lock into that frequency, if you keep revisiting that energetic signature over again every single day, then you don't have to go anywhere and get it. The new job finds you. The new house actually finds you.</p> <p>The new relationship finds you because you are the vortex that's drawing the experience to you.</p> <p>[!NOTE] from WRITE IT DOWN &amp; The Universe Will Bring It To You - Joe Dispenza</p>"},{"location":"Dispenza/2025-04-27%20-%205%20Reasons%20Your%20Joe%20Dispenza%20Meditations%20Aren%27t%20Working/","title":"2025 04 27   5 Reasons Your Joe Dispenza Meditations Aren't Working","text":"<p>Your Joe Dispenza meditations aren't working, and it's not because the technique is flawed, but it's because of how you may be approaching it. And after working with hundreds of clients, I've discovered 5 critical mistakes that are blocking your results. Now, most people are stuck in what I call meditation limbo, they're doing the practice but missing the transformation.</p> <p>And so today I'm going to show you exactly how to fix these blocks and finally experience the breakthrough that you've been waiting for. Now, here's the thing, I tried Joe Dispenza's meditations for months, years actually with zero results. I was doing everything right, following every step, and still nothing.</p> <p>Then I discovered 5 mistakes that were blocking my manifestations, and within weeks, weeks, everything shifted. So please write this down, take notes, because these are actually going to change your practice completely. Now, the first reason that your meditations aren't working is something nobody talks about, inconsistent practice that is literally creating conflicting neural pathways in your brain.</p> <p>Think about this, you meditate in the morning, you feel amazing, creating those neural connections, and then what happens? Well, sometimes you may go right back to your old frequency for the rest of the day. I've seen with clients that they go back to their old self, their old frequency, right after meditation. And so, it's like trying to build a house where you add one more brick in the morning and then you spend the rest of the day tearing down three bricks.</p> <p>You take one step, take three steps back. Now, your brain doesn't know which pattern to strengthen. Which neural pathway is it going to strengthen? Because remember, by the age 39, by age 35, 95% of who we are becomes a set of memorized behaviors, emotional reactions, and habits.</p> <p>When you meditate inconsistently, or when you have an inconsistent state of being, you're actually strengthening the neural conflict, not resolving it. And I remember when I first started Joe's work, I'd do an amazing meditation in the morning, feel incredible, and then I would check my phone immediately, see an email from a client who hadn't paid, and then boom, right back into stress, cortisol, adrenaline, the exact opposite of what I just meditated for. Now, here's what changed everything.</p> <p>Instead of just meditating once a day, I started doing what I call reinforcements. And so, every two hours, I would take 60 seconds just to reconnect with that elevated emotion from my morning meditation. Just 60 seconds, okay? But this constant reinforcement is what finally allowed my brain to strengthen those new neural pathways that I was creating, instead of constantly trying to have a conflict with them, okay? And look, I get it, you're busy, we all are, but are you too busy for 60 seconds every couple of hours? Because that 60 seconds might be the difference between manifestation or frustration, or creating a repeated pattern, okay? The second reason your meditations aren't working is that you are rushing through brainwave states.</p> <p>This was my mistake for months, I was rushing through brainwave states. Here's what's happening when we do Dr. Joe's meditations. Joe's meditations are designed to take you from beta brainwaves, your normal analytical thinking state, through to alpha, into theta, delta, and then gamma.</p> <p>Now, that alpha and theta state is where the magic happens. It is where you can actually reprogram your subconscious mind. But here's the problem.</p> <p>Most of us are conditioned to rush through everything in life, right? It's been conditioned in us. Everyone's just rushing, everyone's just go, go, go. You look around in public, everyone's just trying to rush through their next destination.</p> <p>And we rush in meditation too. We're like, okay, breathing, check, body scan, check, now let's get to the good stuff. We never drop into that theta state where transformation happens.</p> <p>Your analytical mind, that voice that's always yapping away, it lives in high beta brainwaves. And that analytical mind is going to fight you. It's going to send you thoughts like, this isn't working, I don't have time for this.</p> <p>Then I remember to check that email or reply to that email. And this is the moment people quit. But these thoughts aren't yours.</p> <p>Remember, they are just your old programming trying to maintain control. Oh man, and I remember trying to, sitting in a meditation and my mind would race with thoughts like, you've got a full on day today. And then I would think about what type of content to create.</p> <p>Or, this isn't working, you know what I mean? I would get frustrated and give up, literally, I would stand up from my meditation. But then I learned something, and this changed everything. Instead of finding these thoughts, I started to simply observe them.</p> <p>Oh, there's my old self again. Or sometimes when it is really fighting me, I would be stern with these thoughts. I would declare it, hey, I'm meditating right now, try it, it works.</p> <p>And I would gently return back to my breath, and then allowing myself to sink deeper and deeper back into the present moment, and relaxing even more. Simple as that. The key is patience.</p> <p>It takes time for your brain to slow down into these waves. On average, maybe it takes about 10 to 15 minutes of consistent meditation before you stop dropping into those deeper states. If you are rushing or checking the time, you're never going to get there.</p> <p>So, here's what I started doing. I picked a beautiful song without Jo's voice, and just focused on getting my nervous system to relax, just by breathing and relaxing for the whole song, 5-10 minutes. This gives me permission to take my time to get into that state, without the pressure of doing it right or doing it fast.</p> <p>Third reason your meditations aren't working is, this is most critical. You are not generating enough emotional intensity during your mental rehearsals. This was a big breakthrough.</p> <p>For months, I was mentally rehearsing my desired reality, seeing it clearly in my mind's eye, but I wasn't feeling it with any emotional intensity. Now here's the thing, Jo says your thoughts are electrical, but your emotions are magnetic. They are what actually draws your creation to you.</p> <p>And Jo talks about this all the time, it's not enough to think about your new reality, you have to feel it so completely that your body believes it's already happening. But here's what most people get wrong, they try to create positive emotions from a place of lack, like trying to be wealthy while staring at your empty bank account, right? It doesn't work, because your body knows you're faking it. Now listen very carefully, the secret is what I call emotional borrowing.</p> <p>Instead of trying to force emotions about something you don't have yet, borrow an emotional intensity from an experience you have already had. For example, maybe remember a time where you felt absolute joy, gratitude, a love, an accomplishment, right? When you accomplish something, and really step into that memory. You see what you see, experience what you were experiencing, hear what you heard, feel what you felt, and get that emotion flowing into your body first, and then while maintaining that elevated emotional state, introduce your mental rehearsal.</p> <p>That's it. That simple trigger is going to help you out. Now this is the difference between intellectual mental rehearsal and embodied mental rehearsal.</p> <p>One is just thinking, the other is being. And I remember when I finally got this, instead of trying to feel wealthy, which was hard because I was in debt, like 6 figures worth of debt, I recalled the feeling of holding my nephew for the first time, and that overwhelming love and gratitude. I got that emotion flowing through my body.</p> <p>And then while maintaining that state, I introduced my mental rehearsal of financial abundance. I was doing changing boxes a lot, and so it was just a feeling of love, gratitude, feeling of relief. The difference was night and day, because my body was already in that elevated emotional state, and so it could accept the new programming without resistance.</p> <p>It could accept that mental rehearsal without resistance. Here's your homework. Before your next meditation, make a list of at least 3-5 peak emotional experiences from your past, and I know you've had some.</p> <p>Times where you felt absolutely joy, joyous, love, gratitude, accomplishment, powerful. Use these as emotional launching pads. Now, the fourth reason your meditations aren't working is that you understand Joe's work intellectually, but you haven't embodied the work.</p> <p>This is a big one, and this was me for so long. I could explain quantum physics, I could explain epigenetics, all the work, heart coherence. I knew all the concepts.</p> <p>I was that annoying guy at the parties talking about how thoughts create reality. But I wasn't living it. I wasn't even talking to the girls that I would go on dates with about reality creation.</p> <p>But there's a massive difference between knowing something and intellectually knowing it in yourselves. Your body doesn't respond to what you notice, it responds to what you embody. Now, think about it like this.</p> <p>You can read every book about swimming. You can watch every YouTube video about swimming. You can know the proper techniques.</p> <p>But until you actually get in the water, you don't really know how to swim. And same with this work. You can understand all the concepts, you can quote Joe's work word for word.</p> <p>But until you embody them, until it becomes your default operating system, sorry my friend, it's going to be hard to change. But how do you go from intellectual understanding to embodiment? Through feeling it with yourselves. Well, it's through consistent practice and what I call testing reality.</p> <p>Testing reality. It is where you take small risks to test your new beliefs in the real world. For example, if you're meditating on abundance, maybe you buy someone coffee unexpectedly, right? It is a small act of kindness that reinforces your new belief that you have more than enough.</p> <p>These small acts build evidence for your new beliefs, which helps your body accept them faster. It's like building a bridge between your meditation practice and your daily life. When I started doing this, oh my gosh, after meditating on abundance, I would give small gifts to my loved ones.</p> <p>Whether if it was just food, bottle of wine, whatever. Each time I did it, I was teaching my body that my new beliefs were real. I was reinforcing them.</p> <p>So start small, find ways to test your new beliefs in the real world. These reality tests are what transforms intellectual concepts into embodied knowing. Plus also doing the meditations gets you to embody it.</p> <p>So the more you do the meditations, you're actually signaling new cells and new genes of that person or of that state of being. Last one that your meditations aren't working is that you are not preparing your nervous system before meditation. Listen very carefully to this because this was a game changer for me.</p> <p>Sometimes I would jump straight into meditation. Sometimes I would jump from checking my emails or from Instagram straight into meditation. Then I wonder why I couldn't calm my mind or access any elevated emotions.</p> <p>Here's what's happening. When you're in your normal day-to-day life, your nervous system is likely in sympathetic mode, fight or flight. Your heart's beating faster.</p> <p>Your muscles are tense. You're breathing shallows. And this is not a state conductive to meditation or even manifestation.</p> <p>You're not in a place to create, my friend. Before you can effectively meditate, you need to shift your nervous system into parasympathetic mode, rest and digestion or in a state of creation. That's what I call it.</p> <p>This is where healing happens, where creativity flows, where manifestation becomes possible. But how do you make this shift? Well, through intentional nervous system regulation before you meditate. Here's what I do.</p> <p>This is my pre-meditation ritual that changed everything. So write this down. This is yours.</p> <p>I first put a calming song on with no lyrics that lasts about 5 to 10 minutes. I told you this before. Just pick a song.</p> <p>Type in a meditation song on Spotify or something. Next, heart-focused breathing. Place your hand in your heart and take slow, deep breaths.</p> <p>And imagine breathing and flowing through in and out of your heart. This activates your heart coherence, which Joe talks about extensively. And then after that is just progressive relaxation.</p> <p>I'm noticing any tenseness or tension in any areas of my body. Once you have identified any tenseness, denseness or tension, I want you to literally speak to that part of your body. You can even tell it to just relax.</p> <p>It's safe. It's okay to relax. It's okay to be... It's safe, right? And it signals your body that it's safe to relax.</p> <p>And just breathe into those parts of your bodies. This pre-meditation ritual takes about 5 to 10 minutes. But it makes a huge difference between a meditation that transforms and one that frustrates.</p> <p>And I remember when I started implementing this ritual, my meditations immediately became deeper. My mental rehearsals became more vivid. And my emotional responses became more authentic.</p> <p>All because I took the time to prepare my nervous system. Now, here's the step most meditators forget. And it might be the most important part of it all, which is maintaining your state after meditation.</p> <p>This is where the real magic happens. Your meditation creates the blueprint. But how you live the rest of your day determines on whether that blueprint becomes your reality.</p> <p>Most people meditate, feel amazing, and then immediately check their phone, remember their problems, or jump into problem-solving mode as well. Oh, how am I going to do this? How is this going to happen? And just like that, instantly, they're back into their old frequency, their old self, old reality. Now, remember what I'm about to say.</p> <p>The strongest frequency wins. The strongest frequency wins. If you spend 30 minutes in your new frequency and 23 and a half hours in your old one, guess which frequency wins? That's right.</p> <p>But how do you maintain this state throughout the day? Now, this is what I call frequency anchors. Small practices that keep you connected to your elevated state. What I do is I set reminders on my phone, and I take three conscious breaths every hour.</p> <p>I also create the environmental triggers. So maybe every time you wash your hands, take a moment to just reconnect with gratitude. I'm always driving as well.</p> <p>So whenever I step into my car, I embody myself. My new self is driving that car. Use pattern interrupts when you notice yourself slipping into old emotional states, okay? A simple phrase like when you're overthinking or starting to come up with how or when it's going to happen.</p> <p>Nope, that's not me. That's my old self. Okay, then redirect.</p> <p>Or simply do Joe's walking meditations. These frequency anchors might seem small, but they are what allow you to maintain your elevated state throughout the day, which is where the real transformation happens. When I first started implementing these anchors, I set an alarm on my phone every two hours as a reminder to connect with my elevated emotional state.</p> <p>At first, it felt forced, but then soon it became automatic. And that's when my manifestation started to accelerate, okay? They started to accelerate when my new frequency became my default state, not just in my meditation, okay? So let's bring this all together into a complete practice that actually works. So first, please prepare your nervous system before meditation with heart-focused breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, alongside with a calm song with no lyrics.</p> <p>And then take your time. Take your time to enter deeper brainwave states. Don't rush the process, okay? There is no destination in meditation.</p> <p>And then next is generate authentic emotional intensity by borrowing from previous experiences in your past. And then test your new beliefs in the real world to move from intellectual understanding to embodiment. And then maintain your elevated state throughout the day with frequency anchors.</p> <p>How simple is that? It's simple, but it is not easy. But practice consistently. Daily meditation plus reinforcement moments every few hours.</p> <p>This complete practice addresses all five reasons why your Zhou meditations haven't been working. And when you implement these things consistently, I promise you, everything will change. Everything Zhou is speaking about is absolutely true.</p> <p>Everything will change. I went from frustrated and in debt to manifesting opportunities that I couldn't have ever imagined, ever have imagined. But more importantly, I went from constantly seeking outside of myself to finding that unshakable inner peace that Zhou talks about.</p> <p>That state where you no longer are emotionally dependent on the conditions in your life. And that, that's the real gift of this work. Yeah, the manifestations are amazing, but the true transformation is who you become in the process.</p> <p>Someone who is no longer at the mercy of external circumstances. You're not a bitch to life. Someone who has remembered their connection to the divine, to the field of all possibilities.</p> <p>Someone who has come home to themselves. Now I want to know which of these five mistakes resonated with you the most and what changes are you going to implement in your practice? Let me know in the comment section below.

You are ready to stop waiting and start creating.</p> <p>You are ready to become the person who already has what you are trying to manifest.</p>"},{"location":"Dispenza/2025-05-04%20-%20Morning%20Meditation%20Updated/","title":"2025 05 04   Morning Meditation Updated","text":"<p>Take a moment and find your center.

I wanted to take a moment and personally welcome you to the new CD, Being Defined by a Vision of the Future instead of a Memory of the Past. Now, knowledge is the precursor to experience. </p> <p>The more knowledge we have, the more prepared we are for a new event in our life. And if we can assign more meaning behind what we're doing, we always gain greater value. So I want to start off by talking about how most people live their life.</p> <p>It is a fact, scientifically, that your brain is organized to reflect everything you know in your life. Your brain is a record of all the things you've learned intellectually and all the things that you've experienced in your life. In other words, your brain is an artifact.</p> <p>Now, most people wake up in the morning and they think about their problems, they think about themselves, and they begin to anchor themselves into certain feelings and emotions that reaffirm their personality. And since those feelings and emotions are the end product of past experiences, because that's what emotions are, then people begin to ground themselves chemically into the past. So then they think neurologically within the circuits of their brain that are connected to the past, and they feel emotionally and chemically within the boundaries of those past experiences.</p> <p>And so then most people's personality or their state of being is defined by the past. And if thoughts are the language of the brain, and feelings are the language of the body, then how most people are thinking neurologically and feeling chemically are causing them to function as a predictable self tied to the past. Now, we can call that, for the most part, our past-present reality.</p> <p>Because once we anchor consciousness into the brain and body and into a state of being, then we could say then our behaviors, choices, the experiences that await us, and how they are going to feel will become very predictable. And so people tend to think the same thoughts, they make the same choices, they demonstrate the same behaviors that create the same experiences, all for the familiar emotion that's called the old personality or the old self. Now, this CD is about defining yourself as a vision of the future instead of a memory of the past. </p> <p>So then in order for you to go from the old self to the new self, one of the ingredients that helps you to do that is consciousness. Now, consciousness is awareness, and awareness is paying attention and noticing. So the more conscious you are of your unconscious self, the less unconscious you will go during the course of your day.</p> <p>Now, I picked two very specific times for these meditations. The first thing, when you wake up in the morning, I'm going to ask you to do the morning meditation, because your brain chemistry is changing from melatonin to serotonin, and along with that, your brain waves are changing from delta to theta to alpha to beta, from your subconscious to your conscious. The door to the subconscious mind opens in the morning. </p> <p>So if you begin to think about a new reality for yourself, you begin to think about a new experience that you would like to have. If you begin to contemplate a new way of being, and you begin to take some time out of your busy life and think about some future experience that awaits you, the mere process of thinking and contemplation is the building process neurologically in your brain. And so, we are going to ask you to think about a future reality that you may want to experience. </p> <p>Some change in yourself that you would like to embrace. Some type of event that awaits you in the quantum field. As you begin to think about and speculate a new future event, the frontal lobe turns on. </p> <p>That's the crowning achievement of the human being. It's the creative center. And as you begin to ask the what-if questions, the speculative questions, what would it be like? How would it be? What future awaits me? What do I want? As you ask those frontal lobe questions, because the frontal lobe is connected to all other parts of the brain, like a great symphony leader, it begins to look out over the entire landscape of the brain. </p> <p>And it begins to select different networks of neurons that are connected to the things you've learned intellectually and the things that you've experienced as an event in your life. As the frontal lobe begins to call up all these different circuits, it begins to seamlessly piece them together to create a new level of mind. And as you begin to remind yourself of that future event, there'll come a moment when you'll get a vision or a symbol or a picture in your mind and we would call that an intention. </p> <p>And as you begin to force your brain to fire in new sequences and new patterns and new combinations, you're beginning to reorganize the circuitry in your brain to begin to change the brain to look like that future event has already occurred. Now, your brain is no longer a record of the past. Now, in fact, it is a map to the future. </p> <p>As you begin to be defined by that vision of the future, you're moving into a future-present reality. But that's not the end. Because in order for you to move into a new state of being, you either have to begin to experience the event emotionally. </p> <p>In other words, allow the thought to become the experience in your mind. And if thought becomes the experience in your mind, the end product of that experience is called a feeling or an emotion. Or, I'm going to ask you to teach your body emotionally how that future event is going to feel before it occurs.</p> <p>And as you begin to combine that clear intention with an elevated emotion of gratitude or joy or inspiration of feeling unlimited, of feeling empowered, your body as the unconscious mind begins to believe and accept that it's living in that future reality in the present moment and you're beginning to activate and signal new genes in new ways so that your body is now living in the future instead of the past. So, as the body moves into a new future-present reality, your biology begins to change because now you're in a new state of being. Once you're in this new state of being, I'm going to ask you to think about the choices you're going to make, to review the behaviors you're going to demonstrate during this day. </p> <p>One day, one lifetime. What experiences await you and how they would feel? And as you begin to mentally rehearse what that future day is going to be like, the hardware program in your brain by repetition, nerve cells that fire together wire together, begin to change into a software program. In other words, you're able to reproduce that level of mind easier and easier each day. </p> <p>I'm also going to ask you from this elevated state of being to remind yourself who you no longer want to be, to become conscious of the choices you're not going to make in that day because the hardest part about change is not making the same choices you did the day before. And the other difficulty about change is that we go unconscious. So then if you're conscious of the thoughts that you are not going to let slip by your awareness that causes you to return back to the old self, if you're aware of the choices you're not going to make in this day, if you are aware of the habits and behaviors that cause you to return back to the old personality that's connected to the old personal reality. </p> <p>In other words, no longer blaming or complaining or talking poorly about somebody, whatever it is. And then you think about the experiences you're going to stay away from and the emotions that bring you to a lower denominator. I'm asking you from an elevated state because you're feeling differently to look at the old self instead of looking at the old self from a lower denominator and a lower level.</p> <p>So that process of being conscious of your unconscious self, that simple process allows you to stay aware. That process is very significant. The end of the meditation, once you're clear of that, I'm going to ask you to remember that intention and begin to think about how you would feel if that event occurred.</p> <p>And as you begin to elevate your state, I'm going to ask you to broadcast that energy into the field for whatever you broadcast into the field is your experiment with destiny. Then we will move back into that state of being one more time and meditation will be over and I'm going to ask you to get up as somebody else. The second meditation is a meditation for self-correction. </p> <p>We will already be moving into different brain waves as night time comes along, your analytical mind will slow down, your brain chemistry will change, your brain waves will change slowly from beta to alpha and so this will be a simple meditation for you to review how you did during the day. I want you to do this meditation just before you fall asleep at night. I want you to sit up in your bed or sit up next to your bed and I want you to go through the meditation and when you finish the meditation, it would be best if you could just lay down and fall asleep. </p> <p>That way you're programming your autonomic nervous system and your subconscious mind even further into your future. And because your brain chemistry is changing, because your brain is changing in its circadian rhythm from daylight to night time, you'll already naturally be surrendering into this. And I'm going to ask you to review how you did. </p> <p>What choices did you make? When did you fall from grace? When did you go unconscious? How could you do something better if you had another opportunity? And then I'm going to ask you to put yourself back into that situation and rehearse a better way of being. What piece of knowledge could you use as a precursor to produce a better experience? What piece of knowledge could you apply in this event so that you can begin to change an outcome? And as you begin to rehearse a better way of being, you're beginning to activate and prime the brain further and refine it into the future instead of the past. This is how we self-correct. </p> <p>In other words, if you saw yourself giving a public lecture and when you watched yourself doing it you were touching your face or sticking your finger in your ear, if you observed that, I guarantee you the next time you spoke in public you would refine your behaviors. So that process then of going from the old self to the new self and observing how we did then, allows us to self-correct and begin to reorganize the mind into the future instead of the past. And then I'll ask you to think about how you would feel if you were able to accomplish it in a better way. </p> <p>Also, during this evening meditation where you're observing how you did during the day I want you to acknowledge yourself for the right choices you made. The better behaviors that you demonstrated. The new experiences that you created.</p> <p>The thoughts that you liked about yourself and how you felt. And so take a moment during this meditation for you to celebrate the changes that you made. And that should begin to become the foundation of your future self.</p> <p>And then I'm going to ask you to surrender the whole process to a greater mind and allow your autonomic nervous system to begin to program your brain and body into a new destiny as you fall asleep. And the brain will consolidate those circuits neurologically so that your brain is now further installing the hardware into the future. And the chemicals that are released that begin to epigenetically signal new genes and new ways then allows your body to be conditioned into a new biology. </p> <p>The process is simple and it's a great way for you to move from the old self to the new self. So I selected these times with the intention of you having the door open so you can begin to program your subconscious mind to work for you instead of against you. I hope you enjoy.</p>"},{"location":"Dispenza/2025-06-22%20-%203%20BIG%20mistakes%20I%20was%20making%20when%20practicing%20Dr%20Joe%20Dispenza%E2%80%99s%20work/","title":"2025 06 22   3 BIG mistakes I was making when practicing Dr Joe Dispenza\u2019s work","text":"<p>I've been doing the Dr. Jo Dispenza work for three years and I've made so many mistakes along the way that I wanted to share these with you because it might help you on your journey to not make these mistakes and it might speed up this whole process for you. So the first mistake that I made was just thinking that all I had to do was meditate. So I have no problem with meditation, I can sit down and do a 45 minute meditation a couple of times a day and that doesn't bother me at all. </p> <p>The thing was I didn't understand that that is not the full picture. You can't just meditate and then expect to feel great for the rest of the day necessarily. What I didn't realize was actually to meditate means to become familiar with and what I wasn't doing was becoming familiar with things that I thought about. </p> <p>So I would have a great meditation and then I would get up from that and actually still think really negatively, still be the same person as I was before and nothing changed. So I was stuck in this kind of a loop of being frustrated, feeling like it wasn't working, being like why is this not doing anything and ultimately I was having a great meditation and then getting up and everything was exactly as it was before. So if you are meditating then that is not the full picture of the work that you need to do. </p> <p>So you need to become very familiar of what you think about, what do you talk about, who do you hang around with, who's in your environment, what do you focus on and all of that needs to also have as much focus as the meditations do if not more. What you can do is have your meditation practice which is sitting down for 45 minutes and then the remainder of the day is you looking at what you think about and this is all about becoming the observer of your thoughts. The point is not to not think, the point is just to observe what it is you think about. </p> <p>So if you notice that you think negatively all day long what you can do is start to say change and keep saying change which is going to interrupt the pattern. You will actually weaken the synaptic connections in your brain. Once you weaken those connections you can replace them with much stronger connections that you want to have and this means actually programming new beliefs. </p> <p>So you can write down exactly what your new beliefs are, have these beliefs and then actually program them into yourself and that is effectively what this is. When he talks about becoming somebody else and a new personality what he means is that you are not thinking the same as the version of you before and that's everything with self-development is all about becoming your best self, becoming another version of yourself and this work is exactly that as well. You might find that you start thinking okay well there's nothing wrong with my personality right now, I love the personality that I have and your brain can kind of create resistance in this journey as well because it's gonna start challenging you because it wants to keep the status quo. </p> <p>So your own thinking as well might be okay well I have no problem with my personality and I like how I am and I don't want to change that. That is also a limiting belief because of course you change and develop on a daily basis so don't let your mind talk you out of this as well. It's very easy to get talked out of things by ourselves just by a few thoughts that we might have. </p> <p>So to recap on that, that the biggest mistake I made was to believe that all I had to do was do a meditation every day and I would somehow be completely changed, I would completely heal of different things and that is not the case. You do need to observe what you think about, you need to be quite strategic and also disciplined with keep following up with yourself to say okay actually I'm not going to think about that now, I'm going to install new beliefs, new behaviours, ones that support me and ones that are going to help me to have the life I want. The second mistake I made was having a time pressure on when I should heal or when things should improve. </p> <p>So you might be familiar with this in terms of when you start something new it can be a lot of pressure and a lot of excitement around it and you know if you listen to a lot of positive testimonials that are out there and you read the books and you see people around you that are healing, it's difficult to not get caught up in that and feel okay I should be doing what they're doing, if they can heal then I can heal and of course that is the case. That's what these testimonials are great for, they're great for showing you what's possible but ultimately everybody is going to heal at different paces. So just because that happened to one person doesn't necessarily mean it's going to happen to you in a month like it did for them. </p> <p>So I would say take away a lot of the time pressure that you put on yourself with this work. As I said for some people they can read the book and they feel great and they are happy just to make changes and that's all they need to do. For other people it might be they visit four different retreats and they're still finding having difficulty with different things. </p> <p>For someone else it can be a couple of meditations. So you can't be fixated on like how this needs to be done, you just have to go through the process and do what's necessary for you in order to feel good and to get the best outcomes from this. So don't be fixated on timelines, don't have a time pressure of when these meditations need to work by, when you need to have healed certain things or that things should be improving and they're not because ultimately that is the ego talking. </p> <p>The ego wants to control this, it wants to put this into a box and say okay I know I know what this is, I know I need to control the script on this. Ultimately it doesn't work like that when you're talking about healing the body and don't forget everyone is starting from different positions as well. So you might see a testimonial where somebody healed a disease in a week but you don't fully understand what their whole life has been like, you know you're seeing a snippet of information. </p> <p>So you can't judge everything off those testimonials as well. I think they're fantastic to show you what's possible and once one person can do something it opens the floodgates to allow other people to do that as well. But that doesn't mean you should be hung up on any kind of time frame, any exact routine that those people were doing, like you don't need to copy their exact meditations or you know attend a certain number of retreats in order to get the results they've got.</p> <p>Ultimately you'll heal when the timing is right for you and I think what can help with this is to have some beliefs around this as well. So you might want to install some beliefs into yourself that everything is as it should be, everything happens in divine timing, you've got to trust the process as well. So if you struggle with impatience around this, if you struggle with you know just the way you're feeling and feeling that things aren't going to get better, then look at that, look at that thinking and say actually this is not empowering to me, I'm gonna replace that with something that is gonna help me, something that's way more loving and that's gonna help you in itself, it's gonna take the pressure off you, focusing on time, focusing on the hows and whens and what meditation and what time of day and what should I eat and all this stuff.</p> <p>Just put that away and focus on just enjoying the work, enjoying who you're becoming along the way and all of the outcomes will happen. No doubt that isn't going to happen, of course it is going to happen for you, you've just got to be patient, you've got to keep going with this work and don't give up. Another mistake I made with this is the belief that this was going to be some kind of linear process where I meditated and if I just kept doing that and kept doing that and kept doing it, then there would be a certain outcome at a certain time, there'd be no hiccups along the way, I wouldn't feel worse at any point, then it would just be me getting better, better, better. </p> <p>Now that has not been the case for me, maybe it is for some people but I think the belief that any type of healing is linear is counterproductive, I think it can keep you in quite a stuck frustrated place as well because again you're trying to control the process, you're trying to control what effectively is out of your control. All you can do is show up for meditations, is take care of your body, is monitor and look at what you think about on a daily basis and keep yourself in a good mental state. The thought that this process was just going to be every day improves, improves, improves, that's not been the case. </p> <p>In days I've stopped this work, I stopped the longest I've stopped was for a few months and yeah if you'd asked me that two years ago, oh no never stop, I'll never have any breaks, life just doesn't happen like that. So sometimes stuff's going to come up, just keep going as long as you, even if you start and stop like I did, just get back onto it, don't give up on it, don't just decide okay it's not working, I'm getting worse, I'm not, it's not helping me, just you've got to go through that as well, that's also part of the process to actually sometimes hit these walls and hit periods of time where you think this isn't, I can't do this anymore, this isn't going to work, that's also part of this as well, that's you overcoming yourself. So you have to be on board with this whole process, not just that it's when it's good, you've got to be there as well for when meditations are not great, when you come out of them feeling worse, feeling frustrated, when meditations are difficult, sometimes you'll go into a meditation and what's being shown to you is stuff from the past that you'd rather not look at, you'd rather not be reminded of that, but unfortunately that is what you have to go through to ultimately cleanse and heal and feel better. </p> <p>So just remind yourself that this is a journey and a process that's probably something you're going to do for the rest of your life really, it's not like you can just heal everything in one go and you're done, I think for most people this is something that you'll do as a lifelong practice and just drop all that belief that you know it's A to B, it's all going to be up great from here, hopefully it is, I mean hopefully you might have had that experience where it's just been fantastic for you, but I think for most people, most people have hit walls with this, they've nearly given up on it, maybe they've stopped, maybe they've had bad experiences, things that scared them, but you've got to keep going through those things, just keep going, don't give up, don't give up on yourself and you will get to where you want to go.</p>"},{"location":"Dispenza/2025-07-10%20-%20Joe%20Dispenza%20Meditation%20Mistakes/","title":"2025 07 10   Joe Dispenza Meditation Mistakes","text":"","tags":["meditation","joe dispenza","mindset","manifestation","abundance","identity","neuroplasticity","survival mode","personal development"]},{"location":"Dispenza/2025-07-10%20-%20Joe%20Dispenza%20Meditation%20Mistakes/#joe-dispenza-meditation-mistakes-comprehensive-notes","title":"Joe Dispenza Meditation Mistakes \u2014 Comprehensive Notes","text":"","tags":["meditation","joe dispenza","mindset","manifestation","abundance","identity","neuroplasticity","survival mode","personal development"]},{"location":"Dispenza/2025-07-10%20-%20Joe%20Dispenza%20Meditation%20Mistakes/#structure-summary-with-timecodes","title":"Structure Summary with Timecodes","text":"<ul> <li>[00:00\u201302:00] Introduction: The Trap of Survival Mode Meditation  </li> <li>[02:00\u201305:00] The First Mistake: Meditating in Survival Mode  </li> <li>[05:00\u201308:00] Regulation Before Meditation &amp; Coherent Breathing  </li> <li>[08:00\u201310:00] The Second Mistake: Focusing on What You Don\u2019t Want  </li> <li>[10:00\u201313:00] Emotional Charge + Visualization: The Feeling Matters  </li> <li>[13:00\u201315:00] The Third Mistake: Trying Too Hard = Resistance  </li> <li>[15:00\u201318:00] The Fourth Mistake: Focusing on Outcome vs. Identity  </li> <li>[18:00\u201323:00] The Fifth Mistake: Expecting Immediate Results  </li> <li>[End] Final Reflections + Call to Shift from Survival to Creation</li> </ul>","tags":["meditation","joe dispenza","mindset","manifestation","abundance","identity","neuroplasticity","survival mode","personal development"]},{"location":"Dispenza/2025-07-10%20-%20Joe%20Dispenza%20Meditation%20Mistakes/#key-insight-the-power-of-state-of-being","title":"Key Insight: The Power of State of Being","text":"<p>\"You don't get what you want, you get who you are.\" \u2014 Dr. Joe Dispenza</p> <p>This talk dives deep into common mistakes people make when meditating, especially when trying to manifest abundance or personal change.

also relevant to the concept of personal responsibility and the need for individuals to take action and make a positive impact on the world 01:10:51.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The concept of ambition implies a commonality among ambitions, and in the story of Abraham, the Divine is characterized in relation to ambition, where Abraham is immersed in a situation of abundance, having wealthy parents who provide for him, and has no reason to move forward until he's 75 and the voice of Adventure, or God, compels him to leave his comfort zone 01:12:16.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The voice of Adventure, or God, tells Abraham to leave his father's tent, tribe, and those who speak his language, and venture out into the world, implying that having everything one needs is not how life works, and that one must take risks and face challenges to truly live 01:13:34.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Abraham agrees to follow the voice of Adventure and builds an altar, signifying his aim to abide by the command, and makes sacrifices, demonstrating that transformation requires sacrifice and letting go of what one was 01:14:06.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Abraham's life is punctuated by a sequence of reaffirmations of his upward aim and declamations of his willingness to sacrifice, and he reconstitutes the Covenant, or agreement to follow the voice of Adventure, after each adventure 01:14:40.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The

blessing to themselves, which is the opposite of the lives of miserable, depressed, and trapped people 01:16:57.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The pathway to a blessed life is not one of satiation, but rather a voluntary quest that is characterized by adventure 01:17:19.  </p> </li> <li> <p>By embarking on this quest, individuals will not only live a life that is a blessing to themselves, but also become renowned among others, which is a desirable outcome due to the importance of social status 01:17:37.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Furthermore, individuals will establish something of lasting value that will maximize the probability of their success across multiple generations 01:18:10.  </p> </li> <li> <p>This concept is illustrated in the story of Abraham, who is told by God that if he follows the path

embark on this quest will bring abundance to everyone else, which is a biologically desirable outcome 01:18:47.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The instinct to embark on this quest is aligned with psychological and social well-being, and is therefore likely to be a fundamental drive that facilitates transformation across time 01:19:38.  </p> </li> <li> <p>However, it is possible to get lost in false adventures, such as addiction or pornography, which are failures to hit the proper target 01:20:00.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The central drive to integration across time and communally is likely to be an instinct that guides individuals towards a life of adventure and blessing 01:20:11.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The concept of the Spirit of Adventure is often characterized in a paternal manner, as seen in ancient stories where God is depicted as the father. 01:20:27  </p> </li> <li> <p>A good father encourages their child, particularly their son, to push beyond their limits in an adventurous manner,

viewed as a sequence of episodes, each with a beginning, middle, and end, and the beginning sets the frame for the episode, so it's essential to establish the highest possible goal at the start to constitute the frame of perception for that episode 01:36:06.  </p> </li> <li> <p>To guide life decisions and path, one should first orient their eyes upward, establishing an allegiance with a higher

Mount, where Christ advises his followers to love God above all and to treat others as if they participate in that nature of utmost aim 01:35:50.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Concentrating on the moment is also crucial, as specifying one's aim makes the pathway manifest, and attending to it allows for optimal use of what's present 01:37:55.  </p> </li> <li> <p>This approach implies that there's no difference between focusing on the longest temporal scale and highest possible elevation and participating in life eternal as it unfolds in the moment 01:38:39.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Conceptualizing goals in relationship to one another across the broadest span of time and person is a deeper problem, and solving it would be like pursuing a metagoal, which defines the religious Enterprise 01:39:12.

So, um Like there was there was even one study that was done in older adults And this was like a classic study that I just remember I talked about it for years But other cities have like repeated it since then but it was like 2011 or 20 2012 published in pnas and um This this researchers took these older adults and they put them on a year-long intervention exercise program and there was a lot of Um more vigorous intensity. </p> <p>So they're getting up to about 80 percent max heart rate 75 80 percent max heart rate And for one year they did this intervention um, and after that year they had a two percent increase in their hippocampal volume, so Hippocampus is a part of your brain that's highly involved in learning and memory and they increased it by like two percent So people that in that age group lose between one to two percent of their hippocampal volume per year So they essentially countered that loss that atrophy that they're they're age-related, you know experiencing each year and um And so part of the reason that happens is when you're doing a vigorous type of exercise You are increasing brain derivative neurotrophic factor bdnf and that is responsible for growing new neurons in the hippocampus it's responsible for neuroplasticity, so that's the Ability of your brain to like adapt and change to the changing environment Which is what older adults don't do very well, right? Your brain's much more plastic when it's younger like you can adapt to things That's why that's saying you it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks, right? I mean, that's kind of where it comes from so bdnf plays a role in that So you want more bdnf like you an exercise and particularly vigorous exercise If you're working your muscles so hard That they can't get oxygen to them fast enough. And that's why I say vigorous um, then they're forced to basically make energy without oxygen and that happens by just using glucose and then you make lactate as a Byproduct and lactate is what is signaling and increasing that bdnf and lactate's really I mean you can measure it There's you know things out there that you can buy and measure it, but I don't think you need to I think you can Just measure your heart rate and if you're getting if you're doing a vigorous intensity exercise 10 minutes. That's all it took was 10 minutes to have improvements in cognition executive function processing speed So even just a 10 minute workout and like I did one before I was came here Like that's like that's my thing. </p> <p>I do, you know, it's like I want to be on top of my game So you just can do a 10 minute, you know workout it could be high intensity interval training where you're shifting between periods of vigorous exercise and then kind of Resting a little bit and then so you do these intervals Or it could just be like i'm gonna do a 20 minute like and run and i'm gonna go You know i'm gonna do it. So, um Exercise exercise is the number one. I would say big mover as you said It's also the most requires the most effort the other things and this is where I kind of like i'm smiling because There was very recently a new study one out of three very large Randomized placebo controlled trials where they're giving one group a placebo and another group a multivitamin. </p> <p>Okay. This is a multivitamin, which is The micronutrients i've been talking about magnesium b vitamins folate vitamin k is just Stuff people aren't getting enough of they're not getting enough from their diets And they gave older adults. So these were people that were 65 and older and um There was three different trials of this study It was called the cosmo trial and there's about 5 000 participants in total And the evidence was clear that just giving them a multivitamin improved cognition And it slowed brain aging which was it was estimated to slow brain aging by about two years And I this is like it's so it's it's funny because 10 years ago I was like doing I was out there podcast talk, you know talking on podcast about Huge studies that were coming out saying enough is enough multivitamins are a waste of money Don't buy them and they were saying the exact opposite and they were terrible studies and I like tore them apart But here we are 10 years later Full circle what's the easiest thing you can do like does that mean a young person can take a multivitamin? It's going to immediately make them, you know, I probably not but it's insurance Yeah, it's it's something that you can start now and certainly older adults. </p> <p>It made a difference. So that that's one um, another one is Again, I mentioned that there's other these phytochemicals in plants that are beneficial. They're in vegetables and they're in fruits. </p> <p>So blueberries And blueberry extract or even the equivalent of one cup of blueberries This has been done like the equivalent of one cup of blueberries improves cognition executive function It includes memory um also processing speed so that's something like if you're Like, you know fast reaction time. I guess it's more relevant for like maybe someone who's athletic but you know Fine motor coordination things like that. Um multiple studies showing this. </p> <p>I mean there's been meta analyses showing it This is across the lifespan. There's been studies in kids There's been studies in middle-aged adults and there's been studies in older adults and it's clear Blueberries make you smarter and they make you feel better. At least they make me feel better So blueberries are the king of fruits. </p> <p>I think I mean it's between blueberries raspberries and pineapple I think for like the top spot in my world of fruits blueberries. Yeah No, blueberries are so they have something in them called anthocyanins And it's what gives the blueberries their like pigmentation raspberries have them too blueberries are very concentrated in them Um, they also have so anthocyanins are a type of polyphenol. They're actually a flavonoid They're type of polyphenol polyphenols are a sort of wide class of phytochemicals and phytochemicals There's a lot of them lots of different types of them and they really are beneficial in humans And like I said, there's randomized controlled trials comparing giving this to a placebo and if it was bad for you Then it would be clear, right? It's good for you So, uh blueberries are are at the top of the list for that for improving cognitive function low-hanging fruit How easy is it to eat a cup of blueberries a day? I eat two It's literally hard to not eat a cup of blueberries. </p> <p>It's hard not to yeah, so that that would be another one Um, I think another one on my list would be similar to that would be Cocoa polyphenols so like from from like dark chocolate um, they have another type of polyphenol called catechins and The best one So there have been studies lots of studies on this and it's mixed on this. So some studies have shown benefits They increase blood flow to the brain They increase, you know vascular flow so you can get an immediate effect Where you know if you increase blood flow to the brain, which is what exercise does, right? But we're talking low-hanging fruits easy to do take a pill that would be um something to do It is it's improved cognition executive function and there's a type called coco via and I have no affiliation with them But they've published their they they have studies published with their um proprietary blend which is again, one of the highest Concentrated I would say cocoa flavanols out there the catechins Consumer labs tested them and i've seen i've seen the data. It's it's very clear. </p> <p>They're very high in in They just outcompete all the other brands out there and they also have the lowest contaminants. So they're really a good But expensive way to get those cocoa flavanols, which are really good And then the other one would be for cognition would be lutein which I mentioned earlier It's in egg yolks not very concentrated. It's in kale very highly concentrated in kale almost 24 Milligrams in three kale leaves and I say three kale leaves because that's what I put in my smoothie. </p> <p>So i've calculated it but um So there's 24 milligrams of lutein. So lutein is a type of carotenoid like beta carotene Like lycopene and tomatoes you've heard of those things before well lutein is in that same category It is a carotenoid it accumulates in the rods and the cones of your eye It protects against singlet oxygen from blue light like this light looking at and also the sunshine when you go outside That damages our eyes. It causes macular degeneration. </p> <p>And so lutein and zeaxanthin is another carotenoid. They're in Greens and they protect against that but they also accumulate in the brain And um, there have been a variety of studies so there's been observational studies correlating plasma levels of lutein and zeaxanthin with certain cognitive scores So like crystallized intelligence older adults that have lutein and zeaxanthin higher levels have more crystallized intelligence so that's the ability to use all the information you learned over a lifetime and like Use it um, there's been randomized controlled trials looking at giving eight milligrams of lutein I said 24 is in three kale. So they give eight milligrams of lutein And something like 23 milligrams of zeaxanthin to older adults and it improves neural neural efficiency so this is the ability to basically Your your neurons can function with less energy Which is nice so that obviously improves cognitive function because it's a very energy demanding process. </p> <p>So so lutein Is another one yeah, I know it's in eggs choline. Yeah, you know cholinergics Generally very important for brain function. It is. </p> <p>Yeah, it's it's an important. Um, It's important for brain and there's been studies actually, um with pregnant women if you give pregnant women about 500 milligrams of choline per day their children score better on The intelligence test yes so so I learned about this, of course when I was pregnant and I was like Well, I was actually before I was pregnant, but I was like figuring out like what i'm gonna do like what do I need? Yeah, and that's why I ate so many eggs during pregnancy because I also supplemented but now you've got like Mastermind babies I do. Yeah. </p> <p>Wow, but so choline is also important Yeah, for sure brain function, but that comes down to again getting trying to get everything you need from your food Um, and then omega-3s there's been so many randomized control trials on omega-3s Improving cognition, especially when they're it's it has to be two grams or more That's where you'll get the the mixed data if it's like, oh we gave them 500 milligrams. It wasn't enough So the studies that are consistently showing improvements in cognitive function are at least two grams a day of the omega-3. So that's my that's my sort of I think low-hanging fruit for for cognitive function things you can do</p>"},{"location":"Huberman/2025-04-27%20-%20Talk%20to%20Yourself%20Like%20This/","title":"2025 04 27   Talk to Yourself Like This","text":""},{"location":"Huberman/2025-04-27%20-%20Talk%20to%20Yourself%20Like%20This/#talk-to-yourself-like-this-for-3-days-rewire-your-brain-reset-your-mind-dr-andrew-huberman","title":"Talk to Yourself Like This for 3 Days: Rewire Your Brain &amp; Reset Your Mind (Dr. Andrew Huberman)","text":""},{"location":"Huberman/2025-04-27%20-%20Talk%20to%20Yourself%20Like%20This/#chapter-1-the-power-of-self-talk","title":"Chapter 1: The Power of Self-Talk","text":"<p>The way you speak to yourself changes the way your brain rewires itself.

It's not just psychology, it's neurobiology. And in just 3 days, you can start to reshape your internal landscape. What if I told you that your internal dialogue, the words you use with yourself, has a direct and measurable impact on your neurochemistry? That it affects your levels of dopamine, adrenaline, and even GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in your brain. For 3 days, I want you to run an experiment. This is not positive thinking. This is selfdirected neuroplasticity. When you deliberately change your inner language, you're tapping into the prefrontal cortex, the anterior singulate and the insula, areas of the brain responsible for self-awareness, emotional regulation and motivation. What we say to ourselves, especially under stress, can either spiral us into a fightor-flight loop or activate calm, clarity, and focus. So, here's the protocol. For the next 3 days, I want you to do three things. Speak to yourself in the second person. Say, \"You've got this,\" not, \"I've got this.\" Studies show that this shifts your brain out of ego-based self-critique and into coaching mode. You become your own guide, not your own critic. Start your morning with identity statements, not goals. Say you are someone who keeps promises to yourself, not I will go to the gym. Identity is sticky. It wires deeper into your neural circuitry than intention. Catch negative selft talk and label it. Say that's a thought, not a fact. This activates your prefrontal cortex and gives you distance from rumination. This isn't motivational fluff. It's neuroscience. The brain listens. The body responds. And after three days, just three, you'll begin to feel the shift. Less reactivity, more clarity, more energy. You'll start to become the voice you needed to hear. When most people engage in internal dialogue, they default to firsterson language. I'm anxious. I can't do this. Or I need to be better. While this might feel natural, studies in cognitive neuroscience and sports psychology reveal that this internal narrative style is actually limiting, especially under conditions of stress or high cognitive load. Now, here's where it gets interesting. Research conducted at the University of Michigan and other neuroscience labs shows that shifting to</p>"},{"location":"Huberman/2025-04-27%20-%20Talk%20to%20Yourself%20Like%20This/#second-person-selft-talk-using-you","title":"second person selft talk using you","text":"<p>instead of I creates a psychological buffer. This shift activates brain circuits associated with perspective taking specifically within the medial prefrontal cortex and temporal parietal junction. These are regions responsible for distinguishing between self and others. But they also give us the ability to step back and coach ourselves through difficulty. So instead of saying I can't do this, you say you've done harder things, you can do this. The change might seem subtle, but the effects are profound. When you use you, your brain responds as if the guidance is coming from someone else you trust, like a mentor or coach, which increases compliance and decreases resistance. This shift in perspective has been shown to improve self-regulation, boost emotional control, and enhance problem solving under pressure. Athletes use it. Elite military operators use it. And we now understand the neurobiological reason why it works. Second person language decreases activity in brain areas associated with self-critical rumination and increases taskoriented focus. From a biochemical standpoint, this can reduce cortisol release and elevate dopamineeric tone, particularly when the self-talk is paired with small winds or progress signals. That means it doesn't just feel more empowering, it literally shifts your brain chemistry toward motivation and confidence. When practiced consistently, this becomes a form of real time mental training. You're not just thinking differently, you're engaging in a cognitive protocol that rewires how your nervous system responds to challenge. So, for the next 3 days, catch those internal moments and coach yourself like someone you care about. You've got this. You've done harder things. You know what matters right now. This isn't just better thinking. This is neuroscience applied. Most people wake up and set goals. I'm going to go to the gym. I'll eat clean today. I need to stop procrastinating. While well-intentioned, goal-based thinking is often fragile. It relies on motivation, which is inherently unstable, and it keeps your brain operating from a future focused framework, which can increase cognitive friction and anxiety. Now, here's the neuroscience behind a better approach. Identity-based statement. When you say, \"I am someone who follows through or you are the kind of person who shows up no matter how you feel,\" you're not just setting a goal. You're activating neural networks related to self-satisfying and default mode network integration. That means you're teaching your brain who you are, not just what you want to do. This taps into something we call self-referential processing. The brain treats identity as something sacred and non-negotiable. So when a behavior is tied to your identity, not just a temporary desire, your nervous system fights harder to maintain it. This is supported by studies in behavior change psychology and neuroiming. Identity statements light up midline cortical structures like the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior singulate cortex regions deeply involved in autobiographical memory and meaning. This gives the statement emotional weight and stickiness. When you act from identity, you're not struggling to become something. You're expressing something you already are. That removes internal resistance. And in terms of neuroplasticity, that's crucial. Repetition of behavior tied to identity forms stronger, more stable neuropathways. The kind that actually hold under stress. So instead of saying I will try to be productive today, you say you are the kind of person who handles hard things and doesn't make excuses. The brain will begin to match behavior to identity automatically. That's what it's built to do. You know, this isn't about tricking yourself. It's about aligning your internal language with the neurobiological machinery of change. Remember, your brain doesn't care what you hope to do. It cares what you believe you are. And that belief, when reinforced consistently, becomes your default operating system. Identity leads. Behavior follows. One of the most powerful tools we have for emotional regulation and mental clarity is incredibly simple but deeply supported by neuroscience. It's the ability to label when you're caught in a loop of negative self-t talk. I'm not good enough. I always mess this up. This is going to fail. Your brain is engaging in default mode network activity. This network which includes the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior singulate cortex becomes highly active when we ruminate, judge ourselves or worry about the future. But here's the protocol. Instead of believing the thought, you label it. You say to yourself, \"That's a thought, not a fact.\" What this does from a neurological standpoint is shift activity from the lbic system, especially the amygdala associated with fear and emotion to the prefrontal cortex, which governs logic, regulation, and decision-m. You're literally redirecting blood flow and neural activity away from panic and toward executive function. There's a term for this in cognitive behavioral neuroscience, cognitive diffusion. It's the process of separating yourself from your thoughts rather than fusing with them. When you label a thought as just that, a mental event, your brain no longer reacts to it as if it's an objective threat. And here's the remarkable part. Neuroiming studies show that people who practice this form of labeling, even just a few times a day, show increased activation in the right vententralateral prefrontal cortex and decreased activity in the amygdala. That means more calm, more control, and less stress. So when that voice shows up, the inner critic, the catastrophizer, the imposttor syndrome, you interrupt the loop, you don't argue with it. You don't try to suppress it. You just say that's a thought, not a fact. That 1 second pause creates just enough space for awareness. And that awareness is the seed of all behavioral change. Over time, with repetition, this simple act of labeling becomes neuroprotective. You condition your brain to stop treating every negative thought like a call to action or a crisis. You restore regulation. You reduce cortisol. You build resilience. This isn't about ignoring reality. It's about mastering the way your nervous system responds to perceived threat. And that starts with realizing not everything you think is true. Label the thought reclaim the mind. Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change its structure and function is not something that happens passively. It's not automatic. And it's not always beneficial. It's experience dependent. Meaning that what you repeatedly think, feel, say, and do literally reshapes your neural circuitry. This is foundational. Every time you engage in a behavior, every time you speak to yourself a certain way, you're sculpting your brain. Neurons that fire together wire together. That's the core of hebian plasticity. But what most people forget is that neurons also prune when they're unused. So you're either reinforcing or weakening pathways all the time. Now when it comes to internal dialogue, the words you use with yourself, this is one of the fastest and most consistent inputs your brain receives. That means your self-talk is one of the primary drivers of your neuroplastic change. When you tell yourself, I always screw this up, or I'm not disciplined, and you repeat that narrative, the brain doesn't debate you. It rewires to support that version of reality. It creates and strengthens circuits that recognize that as truth and that becomes your perceptual filter. But here's the upside. You can reverse it. You can reshape those circuits by deliberately introducing adaptive empowering language over and over again. This is why the way you speak to yourself, even if it feels fake at first, matters. Because plasticity isn't about what feels true right now. It's about what gets repeated. The more a pathway is used, the more myelination occurs along that axon, making the signal stronger, faster, more automatic. That's not philosophy. That's neuroscience. And here's something else to know. Neuroplasticity is gated by two things: attention and emotion. That means when you're fully focused and emotionally engaged in what you're saying to yourself, even just for a few</p>"},{"location":"Huberman/2025-04-27%20-%20Talk%20to%20Yourself%20Like%20This/#seconds-the-impact-on-your-brain-is","title":"seconds, the impact on your brain is","text":"<p>significantly amplified. So if you want to change, not just think about changing, you need to understand this principle. Your brain becomes what you do most often with the most focus. You are not rewiring your brain by thinking once. You're rewiring it through repetition with intensity. Neuroplasticity doesn't care if your selft talk is positive or negative. It only cares if it's consistent and emotionally salient. So every time you speak to yourself with clarity, discipline or courage. You're not just changing your mindset. You're training your biology to align with your best self. The work is daily. The change is cumulative. The brain listens. Key point five, internal language alters neurochemistry. The way you talk to yourself is not just a mindset. It's a chemical event. Every internal phrase you repeat, especially under stress, triggers a neurochemical cascade in your brain and body. This isn't just about thinking positively or using affirmations. This is about how language modulates neurotransmitter release, shifting your entire internal environment. Let's break this down. When you speak to yourself in ways that are encouraging, focused, and actionoriented, for example, you've done this before or you're built for this, your brain interprets that not just as information, but as signal. It leads to increases in dopamine, the neurom modulator of motivation and forward movement. Dopamine doesn't just make you feel good. It creates momentum. It strengthens the neural circuits associated with progress, motivation, and reward. It enhances focus and primes your brain to seek challenge and overcome it. This is critical when you're trying to reframe your identity or sustain effort through something hard. But there's more. Internal language also influences levels of adrenaline and norepinephrine chemicals involved in alertness, arousal, and attention. When your self-t talk is panicinducing or overly critical, things like I can't handle this or this always goes wrong, your system gets flooded with stress chemistry. That means elevated sympathetic nervous system activity, tighter muscles, shallower breathing, and compromised decisionmaking. In contrast, calming self-coaching language like you're safe, stay with it, or you're in control here, has been shown to increase GABA, your brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABA acts like a break system, reducing overactivity in the fear centers of the brain, particularly the amygdala. And here's the beautiful part. You can actually feel the shift in real time when your internal language changes. Breath slows, muscles release, cognition sharpens. That's not placebo. It's state change triggered by language-driven modulation of brain chemistry. Now, none of this is theoretical. fMRI and PET scan studies have shown that different forms of internal dialogue, particularly self-compassionate versus self-critical, activate very different neural circuits and neurochemical pathways. So, when you upgrade your inner language, you're not just talking to yourself differently, you're regulating your entire neurobiological system. You're changing the ingredients your brain uses to predict, perceive, and respond to the world. This is why what you say and how you say it to yourself becomes one of the most important levers for shifting out of stress and into a highdeforming adaptive state. Internal language is neurochemical leverage. Use it wisely. One of the biggest misunderstandings around selft talk is the idea that it just needs to be positive to be effective. But in reality, vague affirmations like everything's going to be fine or I'm amazing often have minimal or even counterproductive impact on the brain. Why? Because the brain is a prediction machine. It wants precision. When the language you use internally is too abstract or disconnected from your actual experience, the brain flags it as inongruent and it doesn't activate the neural systems responsible for real change. So here's the rule. Precision beats positivity. If your self-talk is going to create neurobiological change, it must be anchored in context and specificity. That means instead of saying you're great, say you've prepared for this. You've executed this exact process before under pressure. That small shift moves your self-t talk from empty affirmation into evidence-based reinforcement. And that has a very different effect on the nervous system. Why does this matter? Because precise self-t talk recruits more activity in the prefrontal cortex which governs planning, reasoning, and adaptive behavior. It also creates a feedback loop that reinforces behaviorally aligned identity. You're not trying to convince yourself of something. You're reminding your system of what's already true. This leads to greater neural efficiency and emotional coherence. Vague affirmations, by contrast, tend to engage less neural specificity and if repeated without alignment to real behavior, can actually increase cognitive dissonance. In other words, your brain subtly resists the statement because it can't find real world evidence to support it. And that resistance shows up as discomfort or internal friction. Think of your internal dialogue like a targeting system for behavior and emotion. The more specific and timely your language is, the better it guides your system toward adaptive outcomes. So don't just say, \"I'll do better.\" Say, \"You're the kind of person who stays calm during feedback. You know exactly what to adjust, and you're already doing it.\" This form of language activates dopamineergic and goal relevant networks because it references actual process behavior and identity not just outcome. Bottom line, positivity isn't the goal. Precision is. And when you practice using precise, situationally relevant self-t talk, you're not just giving yourself a motivational boost. You're coding your brain for resilience, consistency, and performance. There's a misconception that change in the brain takes months or years to begin, but that's not entirely accurate. While long-term change does require consistency, the first signs of neuroplastic adaptation begin in hours to days, not weeks. In fact, research shows that three consecutive days of deliberate focused internal practice, especially self-directed self-t talk, can begin to trigger what's called a plasticity cascade. This is the early stage process where synaptic connections begin to strengthen, new neural pathways are initiated, and old patterns begin to weaken. Let's break this down. Your brain is constantly evaluating which circuits to reinforce. It does this based on frequency, intensity, and relevance of input. So if over the course of 3 days you consistently engage in intentional, emotionally salient self-talk, your brain starts to shift its wiring to support that internal narrative. This happens in phases. Immediate early genes like COS are activated within neurons which are indicators that new learning or emotional salience has occurred. These are turned on within minutes to hours of repeated exposure to novel stimuli like speaking to yourself in a new adaptive way. If the input continues, especially with emotion attached, the brain begins to produce neurotrphens like BDNF, brain derived neurotrphic factor, which helps solidify these new pathways. BDNF essentially acts as fertilizer for neurons, making it easier to form lasting synaptic changes. After about 72 hours of consistent, emotionally engaged practice, the brain begins to transition from short-term plasticity, temporary signal changes to structural plasticity, the beginnings of actual changes in neural wiring. This is why 3 days matters. It's not random. It's a neurobiological threshold, a signal to the brain that this new behavior or pattern of thought might be worth keeping. Now, is it permanent after 3 days? No. The real consolidation takes longer with continued repetition. But this initial window is powerful because it opens the door. You begin to feel the shift. less internal resistance, more clarity, more ability to catch and redirect negative thought loops in real time. It's also important to note these</p>"},{"location":"Huberman/2025-04-27%20-%20Talk%20to%20Yourself%20Like%20This/#first-three-days-are-when-most-people","title":"first three days are when most people","text":"<p>quit, not because the method isn't working, but because their brain is still transitioning out of the old circuitry. That's the critical moment where you must persist. When you deliberately speak to yourself with focus and self-directed intent for three consecutive days and pair that with behaviors aligned to those statements, you're essentially sending a message to your nervous system. This matters now. Reinforce this. Make this the new baseline. You are the architect. And in just 72 hours, you begin laying down the blueprint. One of the most overlooked aspects of internal dialogue or self-t talk is its direct influence on the autonomic nervous system as this is the part of your nervous system that regulates automatic processes like heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, digestion, and the stress response. In simpler terms, how you speak to yourself influences how your body feels and performs. Now, the autonomic nervous system has two primary branches. The sympathetic branch, which drives alertness, readiness, and stress, often referred to as fight or flight. The parasympathetic branch, which governs calm, recovery, and restoration, known as rest and digest. Your internal language can push you into either state depending on its tone, precision, and emotional content. For example, when your selft talk is anxious, self-critical, or defeist, I can't handle this. Everything's going to go wrong. It amplifies sympathetic tone. That means increased heart rate, shallower breathing, elevated cortisol, and reduced ability to think clearly. The brain interprets that inner voice as a threat cue, and prepares the body accordingly. But when you shift to intentional self- coaching language, even something as simple as you're okay, stay grounded, you know what to do next, you activate circuits in the prefrontal cortex and insula, which are known to downregulate limbic reactivity and engage parasympathetic tone. This brings about real physiological changes. Heart rate begins to stabilize. Breathing deepens. Blood flow returns to the frontal cortex, improving executive function. Muscle tension decreases. Cortisol levels begin to normalize. In other words, your internal language becomes a lever for state control, giving you the ability to shift from reactivity to responsiveness, from chaos to clarity. And here's what's especially powerful. This control is trainable. When you consistently pair self-directed language with physiological awareness, like breath regulation or posture, you're creating a feedback loop that links cognition with autonomic control. Over time, this loop becomes more efficient and more automatic. You're no longer just reacting to the world. You're regulating yourself from within. This is why elite performers from special forces to Olympic athletes train their inner dialogue with precision. It's not about motivation. It's about autonomic command. Because the truth is, your biology responds more to the signals you send yourself than the circumstances you're in. And when your internal language becomes intentional, grounded, and strategic, you gain access to the full spectrum of your performance cognitively, emotionally, and physiologically. You are your own operator. And self-directed language is one of the most accessible sciencebacked tools to take control of your nervous system and bring yourself back into alignment on demand. What you say to yourself is not just background noise. It's a neural command, a biological signal that your entire system listens to. If for 3 days, just three, you commit to speaking to yourself with precision, identity, and deliberate self leadership, you'll begin to change not just how you feel, but what your brain becomes capable of. The nervous system doesn't care what you hope to become. It responds to what you repeat with intensity. And in a world that's constantly trying to program you from the outside, your internal language is the most powerful form of neurological sovereignty you have. So the question is not can you change. The question is can you become the kind of person who speaks truth into your own biology before the world tells you what's possible. Talk to yourself like it matters because it does.</p>"},{"location":"Huberman/2025-10-25%20-%20Rewiring%20your%20brain/","title":"2025 10 25   Rewiring your brain","text":"<p>Can you learn new things? Can you unlearn certain patterns? Can you overcome traumas at any age?\u00a0The answer is absolutely, categorically, yes. How? Well, it's very clear that as a child until\u00a0about age 25, more or less, just passive experience will shape the brain, for better or worse.\u00a0After about age 25, and again, these are not strict cutoffs, we can change our brain,\u00a0but what's required is a marked shift in the neurochemical environment under which\u00a0something happens.</p> <p>So one of the reasons why any traumatic event will forever be remembered,\u00a0although by the way, you can remove some of the emotional load of that, trauma does not have to\u00a0be traumatic forever, is because when we see or experience something very intense of a fearful\u00a0nature, there's the release of certain what we call neuromodulators, things like epinephrine,\u00a0adrenaline, and other neuromodulators that cause a state shift in our body and brain.\u00a0And the nervous system recognizes this as unusual, and as a consequence, in the subsequent days,\u00a0there's reordering of the connections, so that the brain can prepare for that event should it\u00a0happen again. This is why we have what's called one trial learning.</p> <p>You go to a certain location,\u00a0something terrible happens there, you will forever associate that location with something\u00a0terrible. But there are tools, therapy and other tools, that can allow the emotional load to be\u00a0removed from that so that you could go to that location and feel calm, no fear whatsoever. The\u00a0good news is you can also learn anything you want to learn, provided there's a shift in this\u00a0neurochemical environment.</p> <p>This is why when we are very interested and focused on something,\u00a0two of the main requirements for neuroplasticity, we have to be alert and we have to be focused.\u00a0We can't learn passively as adults, we can't just play a lecture about AI and large language models\u00a0or neuroscience in the room, and then the knowledge doesn't just sink in by osmosis.\u00a0But if we pay attention and we're alert when we pay attention, there's a shift in the\u00a0neurochemicals associated with that attention, what we call the catecholamines.</p> <p>It's three\u00a0molecules, dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine, all which cause an increase in alertness,\u00a0all which cause an increase in focus, a tightening of our visual field and our auditory field,\u00a0so like cones of attention is one way to think about it. And then it sets in motion a bunch of\u00a0biological processes such that if we get adequate sleep that night, maybe the next night as well,\u00a0there's reordering of neural connections so that that knowledge, that new experience\u00a0is consolidated in your brain. You are forever changed as a consequence of that experience.</p>"},{"location":"Misc/2025-07-02%20-%20%D0%A0%D1%96%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%96%20%D1%88%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%85%D0%B8%20%D0%B4%D0%BE%20%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%96%D1%94%D1%97%20%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%2C%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%20%D0%B2%D1%96%D1%80%D1%83%2C%20%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BC%D1%83%20%D1%96%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8/","title":"2025

11   6 Love Experts Share Their Top Dating & Relationship Advice (Compilation Episode)","text":"<p>[Jay Shetty] With honesty and self-awareness.</p> <p>[Lori Gottlieb] Let's hear what he has to say. So, to me again, I think it always starts with self. And you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here?</p> <p>Why are you holding on? What's really driving you? Because just use an example, let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's a nice guy.</p> <p>You don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else. So, even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work. You're wasting your time.</p> <p>This is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time. So, if it's not born out of a true connection, love, a genuine desire, you really like this individual. Of course, there's always things we have to work through.</p> <p>But is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay, we can make something special here? And I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question. Because sometimes we get so caught up in trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here.</p> <p>And we can't always say for sure what's going on with them. I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time. If they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time.</p> <p>If you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time. So, there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen, this is pointless here. But a lot of times and I have to say this especially for women.</p> <p>Women's intuition is extremely powerful. I'm a huge believer in it. And I feel like women know very early this isn't it.</p> <p>But they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance. And this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work. I've seen people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with.</p> <p>All because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning. They knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was.</p> <p>[Jay Shetty] I mean, I love that. It's such an important reminder. Trust your intuition and be honest with yourself.</p> <p>Sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings. Now, let's go even deeper. Number two, how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry?</p> <p>Stephan explains the difference.</p> <p>[Lori Gottlieb] Are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual? If you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection. This is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real.</p> <p>So, to me you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow. We don't have to force it. We just feel so much more comfortable around them.</p> <p>I think in addition to that is when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again, you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to? What do I really like about this individual? What I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface.</p> <p>You don't really know about them yet. You just know you guys had a good time maybe you had fun at this event. You guys were able to talk about a lot of different things, which is great, which is going to also be important if there is a connection.</p> <p>However, do you even know what kind of relationship they want? Do you know what kind of life they want to live? You know, are you guys really on the same page?</p> <p>I think connection is our paths align, our purposes align. So, for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together? So, that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay, is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here?</p> <p>And I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem. We have this experience where we feel this chemistry, we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy. You know what I'm saying?</p> <p>We're just like no, no, I want to keep believing this is great. So, let me not ask anything, let me not run this person away, let me not rock the boat. But that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not.</p> <p>[Jay Shetty] I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are.</p> <p>[Lori Gottlieb] Yes.</p> <p>[Jay Shetty] And that's hard to come back from.</p> <p>[Lori Gottlieb] Absolutely, and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump. You know, because again, a lot of times people you know, this idea that we're always changing. Yes, I do think we're always evolving, but some of the big shifts that you see is not because that's just the way life is.</p> <p>It's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first. And then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust. Now, thank God for you she was able to adjust, but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that.</p> <p>[Jay Shetty] Yes.</p> <p>[Lori Gottlieb] And now everything falls apart from there. So, that's why yes, we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning. That's pure gold.</p> <p>[Jay Shetty] Chemistry can feel intense, but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility. Now, let's shift gears. Number three, maybe you're single and wondering, am I behind?</p> <p>If you've ever felt that way, this next guest is for you. Laurie Gottlieb is a psychotherapist, author of Maybe You Should Talk To Someone, and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing.</p> <p>[Stephan Speaks] You are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work. If you're not doing the work, you're going to be behind. And what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship, you have to understand why.</p> <p>So, are you examining what has not worked yet? Why, if I am single and I don't want to be single, what can I be doing differently? And so, I think that's the important work.</p> <p>So, you're not behind at all. In fact, you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well.</p> <p>[Jay Shetty] Why is it that we struggle to actually do the work? What does that look like?</p> <p>[Stephan Speaks] I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends. And, you know, I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before. Idiot compassion is you say to your friend, look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person.</p> <p>And they say, yeah, you're right, they're wrong. And we never learn or grow from that, right? Because yes, there might be something that the other person did, but also what was your role in that interaction?</p> <p>A relationship is all about relating. So, what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person? And what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about, you know, what your role is.</p> <p>Maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see, but that's so important. So, you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant. Why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid?</p> <p>And I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need. So, that's the work that's really important. So, you're not behind if you're single at 28.</p> <p>It's part of the process. If you're doing the work, you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with.</p> <p>[Jay Shetty] I love that perspective. It's not about timelines. It's about doing the work.</p> <p>But why do we resist the work? Number four, why is self-awareness so hard? Lori's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships.</p> <p>[Stephan Speaks] We have this saying, we bury our unfinished business. We date our unfinished business, too. So, if you, let's say, earlier in your life, you were around someone who was neglectful, somebody who drank too much, somebody who lost their temper, somebody who wasn't honest, somebody who wasn't reliable.</p> <p>We think, when we're dating as adults, like, I want the opposite of that. I want someone where I feel safe, secure, there's trust. But what happens is, unconsciously, again, if we haven't done the work, our unfinished business, we actually are unconscious as, oh, you look familiar, come closer.</p> <p>So, on the surface, they don't look like that person. But then when you get to know them, you're a month in, you're three months in, you're six months in, you think, wow, that person reminds me of someone. This person feels so familiar.</p> <p>And that's why I was drawn to this person. It turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with, is very much like the person who hurt me growing up. So, if you do the work, you're able to see, oh, that person, I see why I'm drawn to them, but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way.</p> <p>And then if you do even more work, you're not even drawn to those people anymore. Now you're drawn to healthy people, stable people, flexible people, emotionally generous people, people whose values align with yours. That's who you're drawn to.</p> <p>So, you have to do the work.</p> <p>[Jay Shetty] Is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person? Is there a collective, collaborative future tripping? Like, what does that look like?</p> <p>[Stephan Speaks] I think the future tripping is being in the present. And what I mean is, what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future. So, instead of imagining, oh, this person will change in this way, or we're going to have this kind of life, but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life.</p> <p>If you're not talking about it now, in the present, you don't know. How does this person treat me now? What is it like when we're together?</p> <p>The biggest indicator would be, we had a disagreement. How did we get through it? That's what your future is going to look like.</p> <p>We didn't agree on this. We were frustrated with each other. We had a difference of opinion.</p> <p>How did we repair that rupture? We talk a lot about rupture and repair. Everybody's going to have ruptures.</p> <p>You have it with your family members, with your friends, with your coworkers, with your parents, with your children, especially with your romantic partners, because we have this misguided notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them, because we're so in love, and we see each other, and we see eye to eye. But of course you're going to have ruptures. It's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture, it's what do you do with it, and what does it look like?</p> <p>So if you have been dating for, let's say, six months, and you haven't had a rupture, you guys are not going deep enough. You guys don't know each other well enough. You're still on your best behavior.</p> <p>You have to be able to be yourselves. That's going to tell you what the future looks like. So stop the pretending.</p> <p>Be yourself. Be what you want your future to look like. Act like you want your future to look like.</p> <p>See how the other person acts, and see what happens between the two of you. And a repair would look like something like, oh, we're having a disagreement right now. Why don't we take 15 minutes, and let's come back when we're not so heated, and let's talk about that, or you know you made a mistake.</p> <p>You know what, I've been thinking about this. Say you have an argument. You say, we're not going to talk for a few minutes.</p> <p>Let's go cool off, whatever. You call them back, and you say, you know what? I thought about it.</p> <p>I was wrong, and I'm so sorry. Here's what I did, and I wish I had done it this way. And that's great if your partner can do that, or if you can do that, right?</p> <p>And then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you, if your partner can say, I really appreciate that, and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way, and how can I be more supportive in those moments? That's beautiful. That's your future.</p> <p>But you have to see it in the present. You can't imagine what the future's going to be. You have to actually live it in the present, and say, oh, now I know.</p> <p>It's going to be just like it is right now.</p> <p>[Jay Shetty] Now that's a wake-up call. Sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid, but that's the only way to grow. Number five.</p> <p>What if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over? Dr. Joe Dispenza, neuroscientist, researcher, and expert on rewiring the brain, explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us. Typically, it usually takes a crisis, or a disease, or a diagnosis, or a trauma, or a loss, or a betrayal for a person to really decide, is this really who I want to continue to be?</p> <p>So my message is, why wait for that, right? So there's nothing wrong with saying, I want to be in a relationship. I want the following things in a relationship from this person, or what might be my ideal relationship.</p> <p>I think people have an image in their mind of what they like, or what their type is, or whatever. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. But I think what people are really looking for is connection and joy.</p> <p>People should be in a relationship. The reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with. You want joy in your life.</p> <p>For me, it would make sense then, if the person got very clear on what they wanted, then they should start on the journey to become that very person. They should really work on being that very person that they want. So there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life.</p> <p>And we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from. Trusting in a future that you can't see or experience, you have to lay down the very thing you used your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen. And that's not something that's very easy.</p> <p>So I like the idea that it wouldn't happen on a date that was from an app. It could happen in a bank. It could happen at a seminar.</p> <p>It could happen in the grocery store. You know, in a way that you least expect, right? And I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves, we're no longer looking because we feel like we already have it, I think that's the state where people attract an equal.</p> <p>Become the person you want to attract. When we focus on our own growth, the right relationships naturally follow. Number six, what about manifesting love?</p> <p>How do we stop chasing and start aligning? Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner. We're conditioned in a way to like, okay, I need something out there.</p> <p>I need the experience, the proof. I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion. The emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it.</p> <p>So we're waiting for the event to occur to take away the feeling of separation or lack. And actually, that's not the healthiest way to create. And actually, we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens, truly feeling it, you wouldn't be looking for it.</p> <p>You would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it, right? So can you maintain that state? Because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion associated with it.</p> <p>The moment you feel the lack and the separation, you're going to believe in the past. And there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is, the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept, believe, and surrender to as if it's the truth, right? So that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind into a belief, right?</p> <p>So the default is so seamless to lose that vision or that belief in the future. The moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past, right? That's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist.</p> <p>That really resonated with me. The idea that we're not searching, we're aligning. It's a whole new way to look at love.</p> <p>Number seven, once we find someone, we often overthink it. Is this the one? Is there someone better out there?</p> <p>That's where Matthew Hussey, relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in. He's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the mind games. Sometimes we're wanting something else because there's, you know, the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough.</p> <p>There really is something lacking in that relationship. But I do think we have to ask ourselves what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship? I'm not a, you know, there's the one out there kind of a person.</p> <p>I've never been that way. If you look, anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we've spoken about it. Back when I was single, you know, I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one.</p> <p>So I think that it's finding someone that we've, you know, we look at what's really important to us, not what's important on an egoic level because I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego-based. I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person. We worry, is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with?</p> <p>Do they look the part? Are they my normal type? Do they make the right amount of money?</p> <p>Yeah, like is this, has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in? And those things can be really, really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with, which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love. You can't optimize for human beings.</p> <p>You can optimize for a lot in life, but you're dealing with people. By the way, even if you let go of this person, you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might, okay, this person is, you know, scores a seven in this area and they score a nine, but guess what? They score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way.</p> <p>Like it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life. And I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment, then you can build something extraordinary together. And actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together.</p> <p>It's no different from a career. When we think of what's our like, what are we worried about in our love life? For so many of us, it's that we're going to settle.</p> <p>Yes. I'm going to settle for the wrong person. Well, I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling and make it into a very positive thing.</p> <p>What if it wasn't settling for? What if you decided to settle on? Because when you settle on someone, there's a power to that.</p> <p>It's like you resolve to say, I'm going to settle on this. I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose. In fact, actually, I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose.</p> <p>And when you realize that, you can kind of almost, I think, look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain. And beside the item on the menu is the very specific, unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain. And you can kind of imagine yourself choosing, like retroactively choosing that pain, which is a very valuable thing to do.</p> <p>Because I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where one rat was on a wheel and was just given the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run. There was another rat. This was rat A.</p> <p>Rat B was connected to that wheel. He was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel. And any time rat A chose to run, rat B had to run, right?</p> <p>So both doing the same amount of exercising. But at the end of the experiment, rat A shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress. Oh, wow.</p> <p>Same amount of exercise, what's the difference? Well, rat A chose to run, rat B didn't. Anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you.</p> <p>If they don't see you, like what is a relationship? It's someone sees you, they accept you and they want that. That's the most beautiful part of a relationship.</p> <p>So if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see, then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship. It shouldn't even be, you know, it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not, it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relationship worth having. We're not talking about a person who, you know, in at least the case I feel we're talking about, the person who was taken from us by life.</p> <p>We're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere, still existing on the planet, but choosing not to be with us. That should lose its romance to us. You know, and to say, well, if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life, if they were a bit older, they would have been ready to commit.</p> <p>If they had been in different phase where they weren't so busy with their work, they might have had the space to really give to this relationship, but they said their work isn't allowing them to. It's like we go through all these scenarios where it forces us into this sad love song of right person, wrong time. And that's a really like pernicious story.</p> <p>That's a very dangerous story because it takes what belongs in the realm of science fiction and brings it into our reality. That's such a fresh take. Stop looking for perfect.</p> <p>Start building something real. Number eight, sometimes love isn't about holding on. It's about letting go.</p> <p>And no one explains that better than James Corden, comedian, talk show host and actor. He shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me. Most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good, hold on to it forever.</p> <p>Make sure it lasts forever because you never know.</p> <p>[Joe Dispenza] Well, then you're a kid with a balloon, right? And you go and hold, I'm never, I'm never ever going to let this balloon go, right? And ignoring for this for a second, the environmental impact of letting a balloon go.</p> <p>Let's talk about it just metaphorically, you know, that you go, this is my balloon. I'm going to hold this, but I'm never, ever, ever, ever, ever going to let go of this balloon. In fact, I'm going to go, I'm going to tie it to my wrist.</p> <p>So it can't disappear because that happened to me once before and it, you know what I mean? I'm going to just, you know, that's it. And then slowly that balloon will just wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great.</p> <p>And it will just then be, then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you, right? And actually, there's something quite beautiful. And again, environmentally, I'm not encouraging this.</p> <p>We didn't know about this when we were kids. When you let go of the balloon, it's magical, magical. And then you see it and you're like, oh my God, I used to have that.</p> <p>I used to hold on to that. Look at it now. Look, it's just amazing.</p> <p>And then you go, well, now I haven't got a balloon. And then you go, well, maybe I'll get another one. Yeah, maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is.</p> <p>You've got to be able to let go of stuff, to make new things come in. You've got to have the space and the time to encounter something new. A friend of mine, a year ago, maybe less, had his heart broken in the most brutal circumstances.</p> <p>It was his first love, first girlfriend, and they broke up and he was just not in a good way. And this was his first real proper serious girlfriend, certainly the first time he'd been in love before. I just found myself saying to him, I was like, this is great.</p> <p>This is great because you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken. You understand how tender it is. And I was like, and you understand it now.</p> <p>And you're looking at this all wrong. You get to do it again. You get to do this again.</p> <p>You're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way. And he's just met someone, right? And he's like, oh my God, this is amazing.</p> <p>I'm like, yeah, that's it. That's it. And so again, I think it's expectation.</p> <p>It's the thing that makes us hold on to stuff. If you can just ebb and flow with stuff, you're going to find it so much easier to take the good, the bad and the everything in between is just all being good for you.</p> <p>[Jay Shetty] This next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone. My wife, Ravi. She's not just my life partner.</p> <p>She's an incredible nutritionist, chef and advocate for conscious living. Over the years, we've learned so much about love together. What it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple.</p> <p>Number nine, how to love fully without losing yourself in the process. Ravi shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving, supportive relationship.</p> <p>[Matthew Hussey] People think that time is the investment, like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is. This person is willing to spend two hours with me, but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me. That must mean the two-hour person values me more, loves me more, cares for me more.</p> <p>But what is the quality of those two hours? What is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference? And I think, you know, I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always, you know, related to this friend or this relationship.</p> <p>This person wants to spend the most amount of time with me. That must mean, you know, that person loves me more. And so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone and loved with presence than you can with, you know, two hours of someone's distracted time.</p> <p>And that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present. I think it's something I've really, you know, I've been up and down with it. There are different times where my mind can just, you know, go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with.</p> <p>But I think it's something that I know it's something I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on. I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them because it gives them a sense of significance, especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost, helping other people. And although that's a great thing when you help other people, but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it.</p> <p>So like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them, genuinely helping them, or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore, like for me, I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things. It was just, oh, this is great. I need to be doing this.</p> <p>This person needs my help. I need.</p>"},{"location":"Misc/2025-07-18%20-%206%20Love%20Experts%20Share%20Their%20Top%20Dating%20%26%20Relationship%20Advice%20%28Compilation%20Episode%29%201/","title":"2025 07 18   6 Love

hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she

are the nine things you need to know about love the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett the one the only J sh hey everyone thanks so much for tuning back into on purpose I appreciate it so much today we're diving into one of the most important topics in all of our Lives love and love isn't just about romantic relationships it's about understanding ourselves building meaningful connections and growing into the best versions of who we are so in this special compilation episode I've gathered wisdom from some of the best Minds out there to help you navigate love with more clarity confidence and purpose number one how do we know if someone is wasting our time whether it's a relationship that feels stagnant or a connection that just doesn't seem to be going anywhere we need to recognize the signs to break it down for us we have Stefan speaks relationship coach speaker and bestselling author he's helped Millions navigate love with honesty and self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she

are the nine things you need to know about love the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett the one the only J sh hey everyone thanks so much for tuning back into on purpose I appreciate it so much today we're diving into one of the most important topics in all of our Lives love and love isn't just about romantic relationships it's about understanding ourselves building meaningful connections and growing into the best versions of who we are so in this special compilation episode I've gathered wisdom from some of the best Minds out there to help you navigate love with more clarity confidence and purpose number one how do we know if someone is wasting our time whether it's a relationship that feels stagnant or a connection that just doesn't seem to be going anywhere we need to recognize the signs to break it down for us we have Stefan speaks relationship coach speaker and bestselling author he's helped Millions navigate love with honesty and self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she

are the nine things you need to know about love the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett the one the only J sh hey everyone thanks so much for tuning back into on purpose I appreciate it so much today we're diving into one of the most important topics in all of our Lives love and love isn't just about romantic relationships it's about understanding ourselves building meaningful connections and growing into the best versions of who we are so in this special compilation episode I've gathered wisdom from some of the best Minds out there to help you navigate love with more clarity confidence and purpose number one how do we know if someone is wasting our time whether it's a relationship that feels stagnant or a connection that just doesn't seem to be going anywhere we need to recognize the signs to break it down for us we have Stefan speaks relationship coach speaker and bestselling author he's helped Millions navigate love with honesty and self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she

are the nine things you need to know about love the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett the one the only J sh hey everyone thanks so much for tuning back into on purpose I appreciate it so much today we're diving into one of the most important topics in all of our Lives love and love isn't just about romantic relationships it's about understanding ourselves building meaningful connections and growing into the best versions of who we are so in this special compilation episode I've gathered wisdom from some of the best Minds out there to help you navigate love with more clarity confidence and purpose number one how do we know if someone is wasting our time whether it's a relationship that feels stagnant or a connection that just doesn't seem to be going anywhere we need to recognize the signs to break it down for us we have Stefan speaks relationship coach speaker and bestselling author he's helped Millions navigate love with honesty and self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she

are the nine things you need to know about love the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett the one the only J sh hey everyone thanks so much for tuning back into on purpose I appreciate it so much today we're diving into one of the most important topics in all of our Lives love and love isn't just about romantic relationships it's about understanding ourselves building meaningful connections and growing into the best versions of who we are so in this special compilation episode I've gathered wisdom from some of the best Minds out there to help you navigate love with more clarity confidence and purpose number one how do we know if someone is wasting our time whether it's a relationship that feels stagnant or a connection that just doesn't seem to be going anywhere we need to recognize the signs to break it down for us we have Stefan speaks relationship coach speaker and bestselling author he's helped Millions navigate love with honesty and self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she

are the nine things you need to know about love the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett the one the only J sh hey everyone thanks so much for tuning back into on purpose I appreciate it so much today we're diving into one of the most important topics in all of our Lives love and love isn't just about romantic relationships it's about understanding ourselves building meaningful connections and growing into the best versions of who we are so in this special compilation episode I've gathered wisdom from some of the best Minds out there to help you navigate love with more clarity confidence and purpose number one how do we know if someone is wasting our time whether it's a relationship that feels stagnant or a connection that just doesn't seem to be going anywhere we need to recognize the signs to break it down for us we have Stefan speaks relationship coach speaker and bestselling author he's helped Millions navigate love with honesty and self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she

are the nine things you need to know about love the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett the one the only J sh hey everyone thanks so much for tuning back into on purpose I appreciate it so much today we're diving into one of the most important topics in all of our Lives love and love isn't just about romantic relationships it's about understanding ourselves building meaningful connections and growing into the best versions of who we are so in this special compilation episode I've gathered wisdom from some of the best Minds out there to help you navigate love with more clarity confidence and purpose number one how do we know if someone is wasting our time whether it's a relationship that feels stagnant or a connection that just doesn't seem to be going anywhere we need to recognize the signs to break it down for us we have Stefan speaks relationship coach speaker and bestselling author he's helped Millions navigate love with honesty and self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she

are the nine things you need to know about love the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett the one the only J sh hey everyone thanks so much for tuning back into on purpose I appreciate it so much today we're diving into one of the most important topics in all of our Lives love and love isn't just about romantic relationships it's about understanding ourselves building meaningful connections and growing into the best versions of who we are so in this special compilation episode I've gathered wisdom from some of the best Minds out there to help you navigate love with more clarity confidence and purpose number one how do we know if someone is wasting our time whether it's a relationship that feels stagnant or a connection that just doesn't seem to be going anywhere we need to recognize the signs to break it down for us we have Stefan speaks relationship coach speaker and bestselling author he's helped Millions navigate love with honesty and self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of

Content","text":"<p>these are the nine things you need to know about love the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett the one the only J sh hey everyone thanks so much for tuning back into on purpose I appreciate it so much today we're diving into one of the most important topics in all of our Lives love and love isn't just about romantic relationships it's about understanding ourselves building meaningful connections and growing into the best versions of who we are so in this special compilation episode I've gathered wisdom from some of the best Minds out there to help you navigate love with more clarity confidence and purpose number one how do we know if someone is wasting our time whether it's a relationship that feels stagnant or a connection that just doesn't seem to be going anywhere we need to recognize the signs to break it down for us we have Stefan speaks relationship coach speaker and bestselling author he's helped Millions navigate love with honesty and self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she

self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she

Content","text":"<p>these are the nine things you need to know about love the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett the one the only J sh hey everyone thanks so much for tuning back into on purpose I appreciate it so much today we're diving into one of the most important topics in all of our Lives love and love isn't just about romantic relationships it's about understanding ourselves building meaningful connections and growing into the best versions of who we are so in this special compilation episode I've gathered wisdom from some of the best Minds out there to help you navigate love with more clarity confidence and purpose number one how do we know if someone is wasting our time whether it's a relationship that feels stagnant or a connection that just doesn't seem to be going anywhere we need to recognize the signs to break it down for us we have Stefan speaks relationship coach speaker and bestselling author he's helped Millions navigate love with honesty and self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she

Content","text":"<p>these are the nine things you need to know about love the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett the one the only J sh hey everyone thanks so much for tuning back into on purpose I appreciate it so much today we're diving into one of the most important topics in all of our Lives love and love isn't just about romantic relationships it's about understanding ourselves building meaningful connections and growing into the best versions of who we are so in this special compilation episode I've gathered wisdom from some of the best Minds out there to help you navigate love with more clarity confidence and purpose number one how do we know if someone is wasting our time whether it's a relationship that feels stagnant or a connection that just doesn't seem to be going anywhere we need to recognize the signs to break it down for us we have Stefan speaks relationship coach speaker and bestselling author he's helped Millions navigate love with honesty and self-awareness let's hear what he has to say so to me again I think it always starts with self and you have to be honest with yourself about why are you still here why are you holding on what's really driving you because just use an example let's say you're a woman and the only reason why you're holding on to this guy is because he's nice guy you don't feel like starting the process over with somebody else so even though you're not feeling it with him you figure let me try to make it work you're wasting your time th this is where you're setting yourself up for disaster every single time so if it's not born out of a true connection love a genuine desire you really like this individual of course there's always things we have to work through but is the foundation strong enough for us to say okay we can make something special here and I think once we are honest with ourselves that kind of helps answer the question because sometimes we get so caught up trying to analyze the other individual that it's like we get in our heads and now we're missing the mark on what's really important here and we can't always say for sure what's going on with them I will say that in general if this person isn't willing to talk about things they're wasting your time if they're not willing to address or correct things that have been talked about they're wasting your time if you guys aren't on the same page about what you want and where you want to go in life wasting time so there are some things I think we can just look at and say listen this is pointless here but a lot of times and I I have to say this especially for women women's intuition is extremely powerful I'm a huge believer in it and I feel like women know very early this isn't it but they rationalize reasons to convince themselves to give this man a chance and this again is a waste of time because it just doesn't work I've seen people people turn what should have been maybe a couple weeks of dating into years of being married to someone they were not happy with all because they did not listen to themselves from the beginning they knew what it was but they just could not accept it for what it was I mean I love that it's such an important reminder trust your intuition and be honest with yourself sometimes we overanalyze the other person instead of checking in with our own feelings now let's go even deeper number two how do we know if what we're feeling is true connection or just chemistry Stefan explains the difference are you even being yourself or can you be yourself with this individual if if you're presenting your representative then this is not a real connection this is them falling for that person that you're presenting but that's not real so to me you H you should be already being yourself but with that person you have a connection with it's a more natural flow we don't have to force it we just feel so much more comfortable around them I think in addition to that is when you when you find yourself all caught up in the moment and caught up in that chemistry again you have to ask yourself what am I really attaching myself to what what do I really like about this individual what I find is that when it's really about chemistry we're still on the surface you don't really know about them yet you just know you guys had a good time maybe maybe you had fun at this event you guys were able to talk about a lot of different things which is great which is going to also be important if there is a connection however do you even know what kind of relationship they want do you know what kind of Life they want to live you know are you guys really on the same page I think connection is our paths align our purposes align so for us to align we have to have a deeper understanding of where we're headed and can we head there together so that's why I think though you may feel it or you may feel like you're feeling it you have to do your due diligence to dig deeper to find out okay is this just I got caught up on the surface or there is something real here and I think once we ask enough questions because I think that's the other big problem we have this experience where we feel this chemistry we're so excited and now we're afraid to ask questions because we don't want to blow up the fantasy yes you see what I'm saying we're just like no no I want to keep believing this is great so let me not ask anything let me not run this person away let me not rock the boat but that's going to be what tells us if this is real or not I think for so many people you set unrealistic expectations in who you are yes and that's hard to come back from absolutely and and that's why it's so important for us to know who we are so that we can present the real from the jump you know because again A lot of times people you know this idea that we're always changing yes I do think we're always evolving but some of the big shifts that you see are is it's not because that's just the way life is it's because you didn't take the time to figure yourself out first and then you got with this person and now you want them to adjust now thank God for you she was able to adjust but there's a lot of people that they can't handle that yeah and now everything falls apart from there so that's why yeah we we have to be very careful with what we're presenting from the beginning that's pure gold chemistry can feel intense but it doesn't always mean long-term compatibility now let shift gears number three maybe you're single and wondering am I behind if you've ever felt that way this next guest is for you Lori got Le is a psychotherapist author of maybe you should talk to someone and a relationship expert who's here to remind us why being single at 28 or any age is not a bad thing you are exactly where you need to be if you are doing the work if you're not doing the work you're going to be behind and what I mean by doing the work is if you are not in a place where you want to be with a relationship you have to understand why so are you examining what has not worked yet why if I if I am single and I don't want to be single what can I be doing differently and so I think that's the important work so you're not behind at all in fact you're probably ahead of people who are in relationships who have not done the work and maybe aren't in the right relationship or are in a relationship that's not going to last or isn't going well why is it that we Str to actually do the work what does that look like I think it's so much easier when we talk to our friends and you know I've talked about the difference between idiot compassion and wise compassion before idiot compassion is you say to your friend look what happened on this date or look what happened with this person and they say yeah you're right they're wrong and we never learn or grow from that right because yes there might be something that the other person did but also what was your role in that interaction a relationship is all about relating so what was your role in the dance that you're doing with this person and what you get in therapy is you get wise compassion where we hold up a mirror to you and we help you to see something about you know what your role is maybe something you haven't been willing or able to see but that's so important so you don't repeat these situations where you're in this pattern and then you wonder why do I keep ending up with a person who doesn't listen to me or a person where I don't feel seen or where I can't be myself or where we have a lot of volatility or where this person's really avoidant why am I always with people who avoid or what makes me avoid and I don't talk to the person about what I want or what I need so that's the work that's really important so you're not behind if you're single at 28 it's part of the process if you're doing the work you're much closer than you've ever been to finding the person that you want to be with I love that perspective it's not about timelines it's about doing the work but why do we resist the work number four for why is self-awareness so hard Lor's got some powerful insights on how understanding our patterns can help us build better relationships we have this saying we marry our unfinished business we date our unfinished business too so if you let's say earlier in your life you were around someone who you know was neglectful somebody who drank too much somebody who lost their temper um somebody who wasn't honest somebody who wasn't reliable we think when we're as adults like I want the opposite of that I want someone where I feel safe secure there's trust but what happens is unconsciously again if we haven't done the work or unfinished business we actually are unconscious is oh you look familiar come closer so on the surface they don't look like that person but then when you get to know them you're a month in you're three months in you're six months in you think wow that person reminds me of someone this person feels so familiar and that's why I was drawn on to this person it turns out this person is very much like what I grew up with is very much like the person who hurt me growing up so if you do the work you're able to see oh that person I see why I'm drawn to them but I'm not drawn to them in a healthy way and then if you do even more work you're not even drawn to those people anymore now you're drawn to healthy people stable people flexible people emotionally generous people people whose values align with yours that's who you're drawn to so you you have to do the work is there a healthy way of future tripping with the person is there a collective collaborative future tripping like what what does that look like I think the future tripping is being in the present and what I mean is what's happening now is what it's going to look like in the future so instead of imagining oh this person will change in this way or this this we're going to have this kind of life but you don't know if the other person wants that kind of life if you're not talking about it now in the present you don't know how do how does this person treat me now what is it like when we're together the biggest indicator would be we had a disagreement how did we get through it that's what your future is going to look like we didn't agree on this we were frustrated with each other we had a difference of opinion how did we repair that rupture we talk a lot about rupture and repair everybody's going to have ruptures you have it with your family members with your friends with your co-workers with your parents with your children especially with your romantic partners because we have this misguiding notion that we shouldn't have a rupture with them because we're so in love and we see each other and we see eye to eye but of course you're going to have ruptures it's not so much whether you're going to have a rupture it's what do you do with it and what does it look like so if you have been dating for let's say six months and you haven't had a rupture you guys are not going deep enough you guys don't know each other well enough you're still on your best behavior you have to be able to be yourselves that's going to tell you what the future looks like so stop the pretending be yourself be see what you want your future to look like act like you want your future to look like see how the other person acts and see what happens between the two of you and a repair would look like something like oh I didn't you know we're having a disagreement right now why don't we take 15 minutes and let's come back when we're not so heated and let's talk about that or you know you made a mistake um you know what I've been thinking about this you know say you have an argument you say we're not going to talk for a few minutes let's go cool off whatever um you call them back and you say you know what I thought about it I was wrong and I'm so sorry here's what I did and I wish I had done it this way and that's great if your partner can do that or if you can do that right and then if your partner then can accept that without shaming you if your partner can say I really appreciate that and I wish that I had reacted differently in this way and how can I be more supportive in those moments that's beautiful that's your future but you have to see it in the present you can't imagine what the future's going to be you have to actually live it in the present and say oh now I know it's going to be just like it is right now now that's a wakeup call sometimes doing the work means facing things we'd rather avoid but that's the only way to grow number five what if we keep attracting the same type of relationships over and over Dr Joe dispenser neuroscientist researcher and and expert on rewiring the brain explains how we can break free from those cycles and attract relationships that truly align with us typically it usually takes a crisis or a disease or a diagnosis or trauma or a loss or betrayal uh for a person to really decide is this really who I want to continue to be so my message is why wait for that right so so there's nothing wrong with saying I want to be in a relationship I want the following things in a relationship uh from this person or what what might what might be my ideal relationship I think people have an image in their mind of what they like or what they're type is or whatever I don't think there's anything wrong with that but I think what people are really looking for is connection and and and and joy like people should be in a relationship the reason they should be in a relationship is to be overjoyed to be with the person that you're with right you want joy in your life for me it would make sense then if the person got very clear on what they wanted uh then they should start on the journey to become that very person they should really work on being that very person that they want so there would have to be some change that they would have to make in order to be worthy enough to create a person that they would attract in their life and we cannot attract anything in our life that we feel separate from trusting in a future that you can't see or experience you have to lay down the very thing you use your whole life to get what you want to trust that something greater could happen and that's not something that's very easy so I like the idea that it that it wouldn't happen uh in a in an um on a date that was from an app it could happen in a bank it could happen at a seminar it could happen in the grocery store you know in a way that you least expect right and I think that when we get to a point where we're so happy with ourselves we're no longer looking uh because we feel like we already have it I think that's the state where people attract an equal become the person you want to attract when we focus on our own growth the right relationships naturally follow number six What about manifesting love how do we stop chasing and start aligning Joe shares why joy and presence are the key to attracting the right partner we're conditioned in a way to like okay I need something out there I need the experience the proof I need the event to occur and the end product of that event or experience is called an emotion the emotion takes away the lack or separation from not having it so we waiting for the event to occur to take away the the feeling of separation or lack and actually that's not that's not the healthiest way to create and actually we should feel the emotion of the experience before it happens so that if you're feeling the emotion of that future before it happens truly feeling it you wouldn't be looking for it you would only be looking for it when you felt separate from it right so can you maintain that state because the only way you're going to believe in that future is you have to feel the emotion asso with it the moment you feel the lack and the separation you're going to believe in the past and there's a story that goes along with the past that has everything to do with the dating is hard or finding a person or whatever that is the story that we tell ourselves that we actually accept believe and surrender to as if it's the truth right so that's exactly what programs the subconscious mind in into a belief right so the default is so seamless to lose that Vision or that belief in the future the moment we start feeling the emotions of lack or survival in the past right that's the moment we can't see that future any longer because we would be looking at that future for the through the lens of the past and we would doubt that that future could actually exist that really resonated with me the idea that we're not searching we're aligning it's a whole new way to look at love number seven once we find someone we often overthink it is this the one is there someone better out there that's where Matthew Hy relationship coach and New York Times bestselling author comes in he's been coaching people for years on how to make love work without the Mind Games sometimes we're wanting something else because there's you know the person that's in front of us isn't compelling enough there really is something lacking in that relationship but I do think we have to ask ask ourselves what what are the things I really must have for an amazing relationship I'm not a you know there's the one out there kind of a person I've never been that way if you look anyone looks back through my videos and you know this because we' spoken about it back when I was single you know I've never been a person who believes in the idea of the one so I think that it's finding someone that we've you know we look at what's really important to us not was important on an egoic level cuz I think a lot of the things that make us question whether this person is right for us are ego- based I don't think they're based on how we feel around this person we worry is this the kind of person my friends think that I should be with do they look the part are they my T my normal type do they make the right amount of money yeah like is this does has this person come in the package that I had always told myself they would come in and those things can be really really limiting and they can have us like constantly trying to optimize for some version of something that we think we're supposed to be with which is a very dangerous way to go about finding love you you can't optimize for human beings you you you can optimize for a lot in life but you're dealing with people by the way even if you let go of this person you're going to find someone else who's also imperfect and they might okay this person is you know scores a seven in this area and they score a nine but guess what they score a three in this other area that you didn't even know was great in this relationship because you took for granted how amazing that person was in that way like it it it's it's very dangerous to optimize in that way in our love life and I I've come to really believe in life that if you find a connection that has all the right raw materials and you both have the same level of commitment then you can build something extraordinary together and actually the extraordinary is the thing you sculpt together it's no different from a career when we think of what's our like what are we worried about in our love life for so many of us is that we're going to settle yes I'm going to settle for the wrong person well I think we can actually start to reclaim the language of settling mhm and make it into a very positive thing that what if it wasn't settling for what if you decided to settle on because when you settle on someone there's a power to that it's like you resolve to say I'm going to settle on this I have to argue that the benefit I have gotten from the pain that I didn't choose has been no less valuable than the benefit I've gotten from the pain I did choose in fact actually I think the most valuable pain I've ever had is the pain I didn't choose and when you realize that you can kind of almost I think look at some of the worst moments of your life as like a menu of pain and beside the item on the menu is the very specific unique benefits that can only come from this kind of pain and you can kind of imagine yourself choosing like retroactively choosing that pain which is a very valuable thing to do because there I was told by a psychologist about an experiment on rats where uh one rat was on a wheel and was just given you know like the free reign to just run whenever it wanted to run there was another rat this was rat a rat B was connected to that wheel he was on another wheel that was connected to rat A's wheel and anytime rat a a chose to run rap B had to run right so both doing the same amount of exercising but at the end of the experiment rat a shows all the positive markers of exercise and rat B shows all the negative markers of stress oh wow same amount of exercise was the difference well rat a chose to run rat B didn't anyone who doesn't choose you cannot be for you they if they don't see you like what is a relationship it's someone sees you they accept you and they want that that's that's the most beautiful part of a relationship so if someone doesn't see you and accept you and want what they see then this relationship is missing the most beautiful part of any relationship it it shouldn't even be you know it shouldn't be desirable at that stage because it's not it has failed the fundamental test of what makes a relation ship worth having we're not talking about a person who you know in in at least the case I feel we're talking about the person who was taken from us by life we're talking about a person who's just walking around somewhere still existing on the planet but choosing not to be with us that should lose its romance to us you know and and to say well if that's the other game we play is if it was a different time in life if they were a bit older they would have been ready to commit if they had been in a different phase where they weren't so busy with their work they might have had the space to really give to this relationship but they said their work isn't allowing them to if it it's like we go through all these scenarios where it it forces us into this sad love song of right person wrong time and that's a really like pernicious story you that's a very dangerous story because it it takes what belongs in the realm of Science Fiction and brings it into our reality that's such a fresh take stop looking for perfect St building something real number eight sometimes love isn't about holding on it's about letting go and no one explains that better than James cordin comedian talk show host and actor he shares a powerful analogy about love and letting go that I know will stick with you as it has with me most of us are conditioned to believe when you find something good hold on to it forever make sure it last forever because you never know well then you're a kid with a balloon yeah right and you go and hold I'm never I'm never ever going to let this balloon go right and ignoring for this for a second the environmental impact of letting a balloon go let's talk about it just metaphorically you know that you go I'm this is my balloon I'm going hold this but I'm never ever ever ever ever going to let go of this balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm going to tie it to my wrist so it can't disappear cuz that happened to me once before and it you know what I mean I'm going to just you know that's it and then slowly that balloon will just Wilt and it will run out of the thing that made it great and it will just then be then it's tied to your wrist and you're dragging it behind you right and actually there something quite beautiful and again environmentally I'm not encouraging this we didn't we didn't know about this when we were kids when you let go of a balloon it's magical magical look and then you see it and you're like oh my God I used to have that I used to hold on to that and look at it now look it's just flowing that's amazing and then you go and now I haven't got a balloon and then you go well maybe I'll get another one yeah maybe there'll be another balloon and maybe it'll be a different shape or it'll be shinier or whatever it is like you've got to be able to let go of stuff to make new things come in you've got to have the space and the time yeah to encounter something new a friend of mine a year ago maybe less had his heart broken in in in the most brutal circumstances it was his first love first girlfriend and they broke up and he was just not in a good way and he this was his first real proper serious girlfriend certainly the first time he'd been in love before I just found myself saying to him I was like this is great this is great CU you really only understand what love is once your heart's been broken you understand how tender it is and I was like and you understand it now and what's you're looking at this all wrong you you get to do it again you get to do this again you're going to meet someone else and feel all these feelings and perhaps you'll go into that relationship ship learning what you've learned from this relationship and that will then feed that relationship in a different way and like and he he's just met someone right yeah and he's like oh my God this is amazing and I'm like yeah got that balloon again yeah yeah that's it that's it and so again I think it's expectation is the thing that that that makes us hold on to stuff yeah if you can just EB and flow with stuff you're going to find it so much easier to take The Good The Bad and The everything in between is just all being good for you this next conversation is really close to my heart because it's with someone who knows me better than anyone my wife RI she's not just my life partner she's an incredible nutritionist chef and advocate for conscious living over the years we've learned so much about love together what it means to grow as individuals while staying deeply connected as a couple number nine how to love fully without losing yourself in the process radii shares her wisdom on maintaining a strong sense of self while being in a loving supportive relationship people think that time is the investment like the amount of time you spend with someone is what the investment is this person is willing to spend 2 hours with me but this person is willing to spend 15 minutes with me that must mean the 2hour person values me more loves me more cares for me more but what is the quality of those 2 hours what is the quality of those 15 minutes makes such a difference and I think you know with I've just been so used to that concept that that's what I always you know related to this friend or this relationship this person wants to spend the most amount of time with me that must mean you know that person loves me more and so I think that's something I've really changed because you can feel so much more fueled from a 15-minute interaction with someone um and loved with presence than you can with you know two hours of someone's distract at time and I'm that's something I'm still working on as a person of being someone who's present I think it's something I've really you know I've been up and down with it there are different times where my mind can just you know go everywhere and do everything and not even be in the same room as everybody else that I'm in the room with but I think it's something that I I know it's some it's it's I want to be working on and something I want to be improving on I think a lot of people love people being dependent on them definitely because it gives them a sense of significance definitely especially if you don't know what you're doing in your life or if you feel like you're a bit lost helping other people and although that's a great thing when you help other people but the intention behind it and what you're receiving from it can make a huge difference in how you actually feel about it so like if you're helping someone through intention of genuinely caring for them genuinely helping them or are you helping them because it fuels you into feeling valuable and therefore like for me I remember it used to be just a way that I would throw myself into so I didn't have to think about what I was doing in my life or how to figure out my own things it was just oh this is great I I need to be doing this this person needs my help I need to like create this space for myself in their life because then I don't have to think about all the importance stuff I actually need to deal with so was the easier option and more of a selfish option but I think that's a value that I have changed I really hope that you got lots of value from that that's why we're doing these compilations I want to make things simple seamless and practical for you love isn't just about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and through all these incredible conversations one thing is clear self-awareness growth and intention are at the heart of real love I really hope this episode gave you Clarity perspective and inspiration to approach love with more purpose if something resonated with you share it with a friend who needs to hear it and pass this on to someone else I'll see you next time on on purpose hey everyone if you love that conversation go and check out my episode with the world's leading therapist lorri gotle where she answers the biggest questions that people ask in therapy when it comes to love relationships heartbreak and dating if you're trying to figure out that space right now you won't want to miss this conversation if it's a romantic relationship hold hands it's really hard to argue it actually calms your nervous systems just hold hands as you're having the conversation it's so

things should I be thinking about in terms of seduction? If I want to be, because one of the central things I need to understand is you said that the pickup artist community learnt is, is what actually leads to the outcome. Because if I was to ask a woman, Hey, how can I become more attractive to a woman?</p> <p>I guess what she might say to me is be nice, be, you know what? I don't know.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] I've asked that question to so many women in my life and I've never gotten a good answer because that's almost always the response is I want a kind man. I want a man who is, I feel safe with, I want a man who is loving. And usually the guy in question is listening to that and be like, what the fuck's the problem?</p> <p>It's like, I'm, I'm kind of shit. Like I don't get it. Like I need to be kinder and they start to lean into that even more.</p> <p>And I don't think that these women are necessarily lying to these men, but they're leaving out the most important part. One of my most popular YouTube videos is the part that women always leave out that speaks exactly to this problem, which is that women do want those things that they list off. When men ask them that question, they just want them from the men that they're attracted to.</p> <p>They want the men they're attracted to, to be kind and to be loving and to be generous and to make them feel safe. But it's not like being kind and generous and making women feel safe is going to lead them to feeling attracted to you. And that's the part that women leave out and men in their, let's say naive, but good hearted intention to give women what they want and to be a better mate for them.</p> <p>They just totally lose out on. So it's better to be attractive. Like if you want to be good at the game of mating and dating, you have an easier time, the more attractive that you present yourself.</p> <p>You have an, you get more opportunities for selection. You get more beneficial arrangements in the negotiation process and it's easier to maintain your relationship in the long run against your intersexual competition as well. So there's all kinds of privileges and benefits to being attractive and everyone can be more attractive than they currently are.</p> <p>What do men need to do to be more attractive? I think they can learn to dress better. I think that they can take care of their physical fitness.</p> <p>For some men, it's as basic as hygiene. You know what I'm saying? I think it's also really important to learn how to talk.</p> <p>The most vulnerable organ in a woman to seduction is her mind, is her brain. Like you, that is her biggest erogenous zone. And if you can learn to talk to a woman in a way that women will listen and respond to, you'll be able to do all kinds of things and have all kinds of relationships.</p> <p>What do I need to say? Well, it's not a script, right? So one of the, it's a, it's a lot about vibing like female, feminine communications, feminine communication is very different from masculine communication.</p> <p>I'm not saying I'm staying away from men and women because obviously men and women can do both. But masculine communication is about the conveyance and information using semantic words. I know that the message has been received.</p> <p>If you can more or less summarize that message back to me, it's like I understood the content of what you said, transmission, complete, right? Feminine communication is very different. It's more like emotional resonance and communication has been received when I can succeed in provoking in you a comparable or analogous emotional experience.</p> <p>The one that I went through or I'm currently in, you can think of it like tuning forks. One of them is vibrating. If you bring another one up to it, it will start vibrating at the same frequency as well.</p> <p>And that's when you know that the communication has been received. And that's really important for men to understand because that leads to a lot of disagreements and arguments between men and women in their longterm relationships where sometimes women are attempting to get men to feel the way that they currently feel. But men are paying attention to what they're actually saying.</p> <p>And they're saying, why are you bringing this up now or that's not factually accurate. I don't understand. And it's because of this failure of intersexual understanding.</p> <p>The woman is trying to provoke in the man the emotional state so that he can understand like in his bones what it feels like to have been her in that moment. But the men are just paying. Some men are just so literal.</p> <p>They're so functionally fixed on the semantic content of language. And the truth is that words are both. Words always have this defined semantic meaning, but they also are in different containers of emotion.</p> <p>Like every word can be said with any different emotional content possible. You can say the word please seductively. You can say the word please threateningly.</p> <p>You can say the word please pathetically. I mean, that's what actors do, right? They invest this script, which are just words on a page with emotional content.</p> <p>And that's what makes their performance enchanting. If you can do both, if you can be very particular with your words and you can invest it with some degree of emotional content, you can be a very charismatic communicator.</p> <p>[Scott] And I guess some, you're saying that some men maybe lean one way more than the other. Absolutely. They lean more towards the semantic information.</p> <p>Just like logic, just like a robot.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Yeah. Sometimes. There's definitely some robotic men out there.</p> <p>[Scott] And what women want is more of the emotional resonance. Yes. And how you're talking.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Yeah. They want a vibe. You know, it's that Shakira song.</p> <p>It's starting to feel right. Her hips don't lie. So it's like, it's this mood that's being generated where the two people, the two dancers, the two players begin to occupy a shared private world.</p> <p>And within that world, the rules don't always apply. We've created a different bounded universe. And that's actually the goal of seduction is that just the two of us here, and we're creating this separate universe that's different from everything else that's going on.</p> <p>It's just you and me here. And we can then play according to the rules that we've developed inside of this little microcosmic universe.</p> <p>[Scott] So I'm going to get my hygiene, right? I'm going to hit the gym. I'm going to get a new outfit.</p> <p>Sounds like you're doing pretty good. I'm going to learn how to talk. Is there anything else that in that sort of initial top of the funnel attraction phase, I should be really focusing on to make sure that I increase my probability of just inviting someone in to the house.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Those things are the most important. A lot of guys get too focused on money at this stage. And the fact of the matter is, is that money is what I call an attraction proxy.</p> <p>You don't need money to get laid. You don't need money to attract attention. It's one way.</p> <p>Like it will absolutely attract attention if you go to the VIP section and order bottle service and you're throwing around tens of thousands of dollars. That was my whole strategy when I was 21. Wow.</p> <p>You had tens of thousands of dollars thrown around.</p> <p>[Scott] Good for you. It was just a pre 25 strategy that converted well for shallow relationships and stuff. But other than that, it can work.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] But at the same token, I guarantee that there is an unemployed man living in his parents' basement. Who's getting laid tonight because he's a musician and he's playing at the local open mic on Tuesday. You know what I'm saying?</p> <p>And he's up on stage. So if, if you're young and broke and you're not cute, then you have to find some way to be, to stand out. By far the most useful thing to attracting women is not money per se, because it's not always easy to tell who has money, especially in places like San Francisco, the billionaires dress like homeless people sometimes.</p> <p>And it's not necessarily power because sometimes the most powerful individuals are actually hidden from the limelight. And that's what allows them to exercise their power with some degree of immunity. The most powerful people, you know, are probably not the most powerful people.</p> <p>The thing that works is fame, is renown. And renown can work at many different levels. You can be, and I learned this as an actor, which is how I got my start in New York City is like I performed on some very small stages, um, throughout my career to sometimes just a few people in the audience.</p> <p>But the fact of the matter is for those two hours, if I was the lead and my name was on the marquee and the spotlight was on me on some level, what I call it as I was the contextual alpha. And within that tiny, almost insignificant world, I was at the top of that status hierarchy. And that's what gets you laid.</p> <p>Now, those same women had no interest in having a longterm relationship with me. And that's what kind of motivated me to take a hard look at the guy in the mirror and think, well, shit, why would a woman want to marry me? It's like, I'm living in this one room studio with roaches everywhere.</p> <p>It's like, I'm broke. I'm living month to month. My lifestyle sucks.</p> <p>I don't really have much ambition except for this, let's say, very vague vision about becoming a successful actor, whatever that meant. I wasn't really, I didn't really have a plan and I didn't really have much to offer in terms of a longterm relationship. And so I said, okay, well, if this is something that I want, I got to, I mean, the Calvary isn't coming.</p> <p>I got to do it because no one else will. And I took kind of radical responsibility for my life and, you know, started down a different path. We talked about attraction.</p> <p>[Scott] Um, as you move down through that funnel, the next challenge becomes actually keeping someone.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Yeah.</p> <p>[Scott] And I, it's funny enough because in my early twenties, although I could seemingly attract women at this point, I couldn't get any of them to want to be in a relationship with me, especially the ones I wanted.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Yeah. What is useful to get a man or a woman is not the same thing as what works to keep a man or a woman. Those are two different problems.</p> <p>Some people actually make great longterm partners, but they're terrible at attracting. They're terrible at the marketing. Other people, they get the marketing down, but they lack the substance or they can't really go the distance from one way or the other.</p> <p>And so it's harder than to keep their partners around. There are two different problems. The solution for one does not apply to the other.</p> <p>In particular, the vast majority of attraction is based on projected fantasy. I don't know who you are. I just see the outside and I'm going to approach you because I like that outside.</p> <p>And my attraction is going to fill in the gaps in my knowledge base with what I want to see there. That's why I talk about, I'm in an episode about how most men blow the first date. They blow the first date by talking too much.</p> <p>They talk too much out of the misguided desire to prove their value to women. They usually do it in a very heavy handed, ham fisted way. And generally all they do is succeed in disabusing that woman of the fantasy that she had of that man, which is why she was sitting there on that date tonight.</p> <p>Because the likelihood that anything I say is going to match up with what you want to see in the privacy of your own mind is functionally zero. So I need to tread very carefully because you're not on the same page as the state because you like me because you don't fucking know who I am yet. You're here because of what you hope I might be.</p> <p>And so I need to be very careful not to disabuse you of that hope too quickly. Right? It's actually the key to transitioning from one phase to the other.</p> <p>It's going to sound real bad, but it's a slow and gradual disappointment. Right? And you have to do this because if you, you don't do it, then what do you end up with?</p> <p>You end up in a relationship where you're not truly known and you're just performing all the time and that's probably not sustainable, but it's certainly not very satisfying.</p> <p>[Scott] And there'll be a sudden disappointment.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] There generally is. I talk about that in the book. The crisis of disappointment is one of the first crises that all nascent relationships must pass through.</p> <p>And on some level the relationship doesn't even begin in earnest until couples go through the crisis of disappointment where either through one significant betrayal or the accumulation of small inconsistencies, the fantasy on which the relationship has been based up until that point shatters. And the person is really no different from who he or she was the day before, but he or she's going to feel completely different because it's almost like you're the scales have dropped from your eyes and you're seeing this person and maybe what sound, what seemed cute and lovable and adorable just a week ago now is completely infuriating and difficult to live with. Sometimes the very things that we're most attracted to tend to be the things that we dislike most about our partners further down the road.</p> <p>It's a cruel irony.</p> <p>[Scott] So interesting when you talk about this moment that some relationships go through where they have that sudden disappointment, where the kind of honeymoon effect, the halo effect of this person kind of shatters and you say that's when the relationship actually begins.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Well yeah, because it's at that point where you have the opportunity at long last to see the other person for who he or she is and you couldn't see that before. You just saw what you wanted to see. You were distorted in your perception by your attraction and you need some of that distortion because why else would you have taken the risk and the expense and the opportunity to pursue this relationship up until that point?</p> <p>Like you need a little bit of attraction. Too much of attraction is crazy. I mean it's completely distortive, not enough attraction and you're not going to overcome the behavioral inertia.</p> <p>You're just going to be so in your head and you'd be like, this isn't worth it. I'd rather just do something with a higher likelihood of success where I can get one of my needs met in a more predictable and consistent way because relationships are really a roll of the dice, especially today. More than, yeah, more than ever.</p> <p>[Scott] So on that first day, can women also talk themselves out of it in terms of the women talking too much and the man going, Jesus Christ?</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] They can, but most guys just are, they're trying to get laid. So like the woman would have to be a total train wreck or that guy would have to have enough optionality that he could be picky. But most men are not picky because most men are just really hungry for anything that they're willing to get.</p> <p>I know that sounds bad, but it's kind of true.</p> <p>[Scott] Well, I mean it's supported by data as well, isn't it? That, you know, I've heard repeatedly that the top 10% of men are having most of the sex.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] They are killing it. It's like what a time to be alive these days, man. And that seems to be kind of the end state of a dysregulated sexual marketplace.</p> <p>And it's not unusual. It's not uncommon. Like we see this in all kinds of animal species, uh, elephant seals, wild Mustangs.</p> <p>It's like you see some alpha males dominate the females who congregate in harems around those men. And if that man is defeated by another contender, the women aren't loyal. It's not like those females love that individual and they'll stick with it even after it's defeated in combat.</p> <p>They just move on to the next one. 85% of cultures on this planet, according to people who know more about this than I do, have been polygamous. And what we see is that when women are able and empowered to make their own sexual decisions, the sexual marketplace, they target the top 10% of men.</p> <p>That creates a lot of problems though. It creates a lot of problems, both for men and women. Um, it creates problems for women because the likelihood that any one of those 10% men are going to give up their insane sexual optionality and enter into a monogamous exclusive arrangement with them is very negligible.</p> <p>Like that guy has to be so done with playing the field and so ready to start a family and settle down. So it's really about timing as opposed to being the right woman. You kind of just have to be a, be good enough at the right moment to kind of capture that man's attention.</p> <p>And for the vast majority of those women, they're not going to be it. But what's the alternative? It's like, how about this?</p> <p>Uh, you know, this guy, he's, he's completely average. There's nothing bad about him. Nothing that great about him either.</p> <p>He'd make a great husband. Like that doesn't sound very attractive. I can understand that.</p> <p>[Scott] Do you still think that relationships are a exchange of value between two people? Of course. And what is that exchange of value?</p> <p>Cause when I, when, when you, when I read that, it kind of sounds like gold digging or something.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Well, that's because often people take value very literally and especially economics. That word just is associated very strongly with money and the collective imagination. I think in one of the footnotes, I use a definition from von Mises from the Austrian school of economics and he basically defines economics as the study of human behavior in respect to means and with respect to ends and scarce means that could be applied in other ways.</p> <p>The easiest way to explain the value is that people don't move towards people they want nothing to do with. They have better things to do, especially when they have these scarce resources like time, like energy, like attention, and that they want things from other people. If I at a distance can see there's, it's like going shopping.</p> <p>I can look at a distance. There's nothing in that store that I want. I don't have to go in and waste my time to figure out whether that's absolutely true or not because I have other things to do today.</p> <p>So it's like if there's nothing that I want from that store, I'm not going to walk through its doors, right? People don't move towards those they don't want anything from. So what is value?</p> <p>Value can be all kinds of things. Value is anything that can be bought or earned.</p> <p>[Scott] Okay?</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Not everything can be bought and earned and I have a whole chapter about that, but a lot of things can be bought and earned.</p> <p>[Scott] Okay. So give me some examples of the most important types of values, values that we exchange in the context of a relationship. Sex.</p> <p>Yeah.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Security. Yeah. Excitement.</p> <p>Yeah. Emotional support. Yeah.</p> <p>Child rearing. Okay.</p> <p>[Scott] And do women and men value those types of value differently? Of course. And what do men value more and what do women value more?</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] That's a tough one because not only do men and women value those differently, but men and women value them differently at different stages of their life.</p> <p>[Scott] Okay.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Like I'm sure when you were doing the bottle service, you were not really thinking whether these women had good maternal capacities, right? You were, you were trying to get laid. Exactly.</p> <p>You were approaching those women with a different set of needs or desires. There's nothing wrong with that because it's actually very difficult for one person to meet this hyper-conflated set of needs and wants. That's one of the reasons why relationships tend to fail these days is we want too many things from one person.</p> <p>And we expect one person to be all things across our entire lives, which is very difficult, if not impossible. It's like incredible that it even happens at all.</p> <p>[Scott] That didn't used to be the case, did it?</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Well, it used to be the case mostly because it was so difficult, if not impossible to divorce. And there were a lot of social taboos against separation.</p> <p>[Scott] But also I would have been living in like a community where I could have got, you know, we're living much more isolated and lonely now. So I would have been, you know, the village would have given me some of those things that I'm looking for in terms of value. I would have had a big social structure around me.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] Absolutely. I talk about that in the book is that we used to live in small communities where we actually had lots of different kinds of relationships with lots of different people and also an extended kin networks and intergenerational housing, for instance. And so with the advent of the nuclear family and the dissolution of real community, we expect our partner to be all things to be an entire village and an extended family.</p> <p>And that's just really not possible. I mean, the love marriage in particular may even be a paradox in terms, because you want kind of, let's say, um, an emotionally stable, safe companion who is also your passionate lover and sexual partner. Spontaneous, risky.</p> <p>So difficult, not impossible. Like you certainly can't do both of those things at the same time. The best you can hope for is to kind of vacillate between the two of them to kind of create a proportion, just enough passion or spontaneity and risk to keep the kind of bedroom alive, but still maintaining the stability and longterm security of the relationship.</p> <p>It's very difficult to manage.</p> <p>[Scott] I find this difficult. I find this difficult. I find it difficult to be in, I'm in a five-year relationship now.</p> <p>I'm like, how do you, how do you go for another 50 years? Cause I, you know, with the same person and maintain the spontaneity and excitement for 50 years, you know, and being the kind of novel, sexually attractive, whatever, while also being stable, safe, predictable, comfortable, present at the same time. Like if they feel paradoxes.</p> <p>It's very hard and you have to be creative. Yeah.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] And it's part of the reason why there are that places like Victoria's secret exist. You know what I'm saying? It's like 21 year old girls aren't shopping there really.</p> <p>So if you're not willing to actually open up your relationship, then you have to kind of make your partner feel new, which could mean different outfits. It could mean play and entering in and experimenting with different roles behind closed doors. It can also just mean travel.</p> <p>[Scott] Yeah.</p> <p>[Dr. Orion] I mean, one thing that really seems to spark sex life and couples is foreign bedsheets. And I think that you've just sort of changed the context. And that's enough of a spark of novelty to bring some of the sexual interests back for the man.</p> <p>I think novelty is more important for men than for women.</p> <p>[Scott] If you love the Driver CEO brand and you watch this channel, please do me a huge favor, become part of the 15% of the viewers on this channel that have hit the subscribe button.

A reminder that we are starting to explore mindfulness as an experience here and now. Now one of the consistent teachings across meditation traditions is that to come to this moment, it so helps if we're aware of the body and the various types of sensation we experience in the body.</p> <p>Touch, pressure, temperature and also the breath. So that's where we're going to begin. Just before we start, once again, for the most part, I'm going to be guiding as for closed eyes, but feel free to have your eyes open if that's what you prefer. </p> <p>Just adjust the guidance where needed. So, come into a comfortable seated position and close your eyes. Let your hands rest in a comfortable place, either on your thighs or in your lap or perhaps arm rests or something like that. </p> <p>Take a moment to let your hands and fingers relax and let that relaxation in your fingers, your thumbs, the palms of your hands, the backs of your hands, let that restfulness travel into your wrists, your forearms, your elbows, your upper arms and your shoulders. Feel your arms kind of sagging, becoming slack. Great.</p> <p>Now we'll come to the head. Feel the crown of your head at the very top of the skull, the the middle of the dome of the cranium. Feel that it's floating above your seat.</p> <p>Just for a moment, imagine that it's like the canopy of a parachute that's catching an updraft. So there's a little light lifting in the top of the head. Allow this to just to minutely elongate your spine.</p> <p>You don't have to do anything. Let this lift happen like an updraft. Great.</p> <p>Now let your face go slack and limp. Let all the muscles in the face relax. Let your jaw relax and sink a little bit, a millimeter or two. </p> <p>Let the back of the neck be a little bit longer. So there's a minor forward tilt of the head. It's very subtle, just a little bit of a tilt forward, enough to open up the back of the neck. </p> <p>Okay, lovely. And now once again, check the jaw is slack and allow the throat to be soft, shoulders settling down. And let the softness in the throat spread and melt down through the chest, through the middle of the torso, down into the belly and the seat.</p> <p>And let there be a warm melting softening into the upper legs and knees, the lower legs and ankles, and the feet and the toes and the soles of the feet. And rest for a moment with a sense of the whole body being warm, relaxed, at ease. Let yourself start to feel the breath coming and going gently.</p> <p>Let the breath do whatever it feels it needs to do. It might go shallower, it might go deeper, might go shorter, might go longer. Let it do what it wants and just become a kind of mute, a equanimous observer of the breath. </p> <p>And see if the breath wants to become like a gentle stirring, like a gentle stirring within the experience of the body. Letting the breath be a kind of invitation to settle down even more, to relax, to let it be enough just to be present here like this. And know that this calm, easeful state of mind and body is always available.</p> <p>It may take a little practice to quickly come back to it, but in time we will be able to. And actually it's always here waiting for us. Thanks so much for being part of this journey of the way.</p>"},{"location":"meditation/2025-05-04%20-%206-7%20no%20need%20for%20effort/","title":"2025 05 04   6 7 no need for effort","text":"<p>So welcome back to another sit in our retreat on effortlessness. So in this one we're going to directly engage with the sense of effort, getting to know it better, allowing it to be present, and letting it merge with the whole of our experience here and now, so that we don't get into a situation where we're kind of making an effort to have no effort. Okay, come into a comfortable seated position, relax completely, arrive here, become present, and let's become aware that just now there is no need to make any effort at all.</p> <p>No effort required. Perhaps you're getting a sense of pervasive effortlessness, or perhaps you're finding that some sense of effort is present. If you are finding that, see if you can detect it as a sensation in the body, and simply let it be present, allow it, and welcome it.</p> <p>Again, if there is some sense of effort, of needing to do something, of trying to do something, what's it like if that's simply part of the whole field of your experience? That's perfectly welcome and free to arise. What's it like if there's no need to make any effort to get rid of effort? We can just rest as things are. The whole field of experience can be just as it is.</p> <p>What's it like when there's no need to change anything? When there's no effort in any direction? Is it possible to rest in a state of no effort at all? Whatever is arising, even effort, is fine. There's a greater, wider welcome that we can offer to everything. Effortless, wide open.</p> <p>Just letting yourself bask and soak in the wide field of experience right now. Letting yourself be absorbed by it. What's it like to have no effort arising? No effort present? Great, thank you so much. </p> <p>So letting some movement come back into the body, opening up to being present here, where we are. Perhaps just exploring whether you can become more aware of the distinction between effort and effortlessness through your day. Have a great day.</p>"},{"location":"meditation/2025-05-05%20-%202-5%20losing%20linear%20time/","title":"2025 05 05   2 5 losing linear time","text":"<p>So in this first sit on our new retreat on time and timelessness, we're going to do a brief recap of some of the points we've already been exploring on this trail and then start seeing how we might let go of time altogether.

We have this ingrained sense of time running like a kind of ticker tape, actually all through our conscious awareness, often quite subliminally. </p> <p>So we need to be gentle and patient in how we approach it if we're going to be able to let it go. So coming into a comfortable seated position, checking in with yourself, remembering always that whatever we may be exploring and examining in meditation, it's also always a time of coming back home to just being you, just as you are. So let's just see if we're free of intention right now, not needing to do anything, not needing to make anything special happen. </p> <p>Can we open up to a sense of ease that's actually always here around us and within us? Can we become open to ease and let it in? Now let's see how time is showing up for us right now. Is there a sense that we're on a kind of track called time and we're moving along it? What would it be like just for now, just for a little bit, to let go of any sense of moving along a track called time, just have that notion disappear? What's it like if there's no thread of time, just kind of snaps, falls away, and there's just the experience going on right now? What would it be like if there was really nowhere else to be? No other time or place, just here and now. Can you sense the ease, the peace, the freedom of there being no time, of time falling away? Okay, so letting there be a little movement in your fingers, in your toes, open your eyes. </p> <p>We're just beginning to explore meditation free of a sense of time. Thank you so much and have a great day.</p>"},{"location":"meditation/2025-05-17%20-%2014-7%20Non-dual%20awereness/","title":"2025 05 17   14 7 Non dual awereness","text":"<p>Some traditions say that the real nature of awareness is that it's entirely all-pervading, absolutely everywhere, and that, in and of itself, it's empty, or pure, or clear, and it's capable of holding absolutely anything and everything that arises. But it itself is without characteristics, and therefore it's non-dual, because it doesn't oppose anything against anything else. Non-dual awareness. </p> <p>So let's see if we can maybe get a little taste of this in this session. So, settling in, coming into stillness, coming into quiet. Imagine that your body is like a town by the seashore.</p> <p>Imagine that a mist is rolling in off the sea, and that mist is non-dual awareness, all-pervasive, all-inclusive awareness. And it's rolling in off the sea into the streets of your body. Feel it gently invading your body, like a sea mist gently moving through the streets of a seaside town.</p> <p>Feel non-dual awareness gently pervading your experience, your sense of being here. Feel that this inclusive non-dual awareness has infiltrated you, has infiltrated the whole field of your experience. Non-dual awareness has no past, no future, only now.</p> <p>And it includes everything. Let this non-dual awareness pervade you, fill you, spread all through your experience, calming you and energising you in equal measure. Sometimes we lose all sense of distance, everything's equally present.</p> <p>Sometimes it's as if we have no centre, there's just a warm presence gently buzzing all through experience. We don't have to do anything, just welcome awareness. Okay, so when you feel ready, let's bring this meditation to a close.</p> <p>Once again, thank you for trying these practices out, in this case allowing non-dual awareness to pervade our experience. For sure, some of these sessions will work for us more than others. Please don't worry if some of them aren't speaking to you.</p> <p>The important thing is just to keep moving. There's a saying in Zen, if you walk in the mist, you get wet. If we keep doing our practice, gradually things start to stick.</p> <p>Have a great day.</p>"}]}
